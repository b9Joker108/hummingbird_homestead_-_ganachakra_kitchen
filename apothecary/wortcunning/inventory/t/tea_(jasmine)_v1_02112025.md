# Jasmine Tea #

I just purchased Jasmine tea and it has quite a presence of Jasmine flowers in it. Is that standard?

Regarding your jasmine tea with a noticeable presence of jasmine flowers, this does occur but is **not always standard** depending on the type and quality of jasmine tea:

- Traditionally, jasmine tea production involves **scenting tea leaves (usually green tea) with fresh jasmine flowers** multiple times, allowing the flowers to impart fragrance to the leaves [11][20].  
- After the scenting, **most high-quality jasmine teas remove the jasmine flowers**, so the tea leaves carry the floral aroma without many visible petals remaining in the final product [20].  
- Some commercial or specialty jasmine teas may include **whole or partial jasmine flowers mixed with the tea leaves** for aesthetic appeal, enhanced aroma, or to highlight artisanal production methods [11].  
- The amount of jasmine flowers present can vary with tradition, quality grade, and regional techniques. Presence of flowers means a more perfumed, sensory-rich tea but may also impact cost and shelf-life.

### Summary

A pronounced presence of jasmine flowers in your jasmine tea is not unusual and can indicate a more traditional or artisanal style of jasmine tea. However, many jasmine teas contain mostly scented leaves with few or no flowers remaining after processing. Both approaches are authentic and depend on production choices.

If you prefer a specific profile or want to confirm quality, seeking teas labeled with production methods or certified artisanal origins can guide your choice.
