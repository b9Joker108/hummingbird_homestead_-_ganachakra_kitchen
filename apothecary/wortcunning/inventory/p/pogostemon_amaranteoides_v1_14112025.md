Systematic explication (word‑by‑word, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph)

Heading and number
* The number "10" denotes an ordinal number in the species list: this is the tenth species entry in the treatment.

* P.
  * abbreviation of the generic name; in context this is Pogostemon (or another genus beginning with P. used in that work); the full genus is understood from the surrounding treatment.

- amaranteoides
  - specific epithet. Formed from “Amaranthus” (or resembling Amaranthus) + the suffix “-oides” meaning “resembling” → “resembling Amaranthus”; spelled here as amaranteoides (orthography preserved from the original).

Main descriptive clause (single long Latin sentence)
- tenuissime pubescens
  - tenuissime: adverb (superlative of tenuis) = very thinly, very finely.
  - pubescens: present participle of pubescere = pubescent; covered with soft, short hairs.
  - Combined meaning: “very finely pubescent” (i.e., with extremely fine short hairs).

- vel
  - conjunction = “or”.

- glabratus
  - adjective, meaning “glabrous” or “nearly hairless”; here contrasts with pubescens: the plant may be very finely pubescent or else essentially glabrous.

- foliis amplis ovatis oblongisve inciso-serratis basi angustatis
  - foliis: ablative plural of folium (leaf), used here to list leaf characters; “with leaves”.
  - amplis: adjective (abl. pl.) = large, broad.
  - ovatis: adjective = ovate (egg-shaped).
  - oblongisve: oblongis (oblong) + enclitic -ve = “or oblong”; so “ovate or oblong”.
  - inciso-serratis: compound adjective = inciso-serrate; margin cut and serrated; inciso- implying deeply or distinctly incised; serratis = toothed like a saw.
  - basi angustatis: basi (ablative singular of basis) = at the base; angustatis = narrowed; “with narrowed bases”.
  - Whole phrase meaning: “with large ovate or oblong leaves, inciso-serrate, narrowed at the base.”

- verticillastris subaequalibus interrupt spicatis paniculatis
  - verticillastris: adjective = verticillate or in verticillasters (a typical Lamiaceae inflorescence type: a false whorl formed by opposite cymes).
  - subaequalibus: adjective = nearly equal, subequal.
  - interrupt spicatis paniculatis: a compound description of the inflorescence form; parse as:
    - interrupt (likely interruptis implied; printed as interrupt spicatis paniculatis): “interrupted” (i.e., with gaps between clusters).
    - spicatis: spike-like.
    - paniculatis: paniculate (in a panicle).
  - Whole cluster meaning: “in verticillasters that are nearly equal, forming interrupted spicate-panicles” → inflorescences arranged in nearly equal verticillasters, forming interrupted, spike-like panicles.

- bracteis minutis subnullis
  - bracteis: with bracts (ablative plural).
  - minutis: minute, very small.
  - subnullis: nearly none; “almost absent”.
  - Meaning: “with bracts minute or almost absent.”

- calycis puberuli dentibus brevibus lanceolatis
  - calycis: genitive singular of calyx or ablative depending on construction; here “of the calyx” or “with the calyx”.
  - puberuli: adjective = puberulent; minutely pubescent; puberulus = slightly hairy; diminutive of pubescens → “minutely hairy”.
  - dentibus brevibus lanceolatis: dentibus (ablative plural of dens = teeth) = “with teeth”; brevibus = short; lanceolatis = lanceolate (tapering, lance-shaped).
  - Meaning: “the calyx minutely hairy, with short lanceolate teeth.”

- Punctuation: the period at the end of this long clause closes the primary morphological description.

Geographic and specimen citation clause (after dash)
- — In Himalaya prope Simla (herb. Hook.!)
  - Em dash separates description from distribution/citation.
  - In Himalaya: “in the Himalaya” (ablative = in the Himalayas).
  - prope Simla: “near Simla” (Simla = Shimla, hill station in Himachal Pradesh).
  - (herb. Hook.!): abbreviated specimen citation.
    - herb. = herbarium or herbarium specimen.
    - Hook. = Hooker (likely William Jackson Hooker or Joseph Dalton Hooker; the exclamation mark is an editorial mark often employed by 19th‑century authors to indicate a specimen seen or authenticated by that collector/herbarium — standard practice varies; here it signals the herbarium Hooker as source).
  - Meaning: “In the Himalayas near Simla (Herbarium Hooker specimen).”

- , in mont. Khasiya et Assam (Griff.!)
  - comma continuing list of localities.
  - in mont. Khasiya: “in the mountains of Khasiya” (Khasiya = Khasi Hills, northeast India).
  - et Assam: “and Assam” (region/state in northeast India).
  - (Griff.!): specimen citation.
    - Griff. = William Griffith (collector) or his herbarium specimens; exclamation mark again an editorial specimen-seen mark.
  - Meaning: “and in the Khasi mountains and Assam (Griffith specimen).”

Comparative and habit statements (next sentences)
- Habitus P. Heyneani.
  - Habitus: habit, general appearance or growth form.
  - P. Heyneani: Pogostemon heyneanus (or equivalent; the name abbreviated). The nominative form indicates the species used for comparison.
  - Meaning: “Habit like P. Heyneani” / “overall appearance resembles P. heyneanus.”

- Folia 4–6-pollicaria, membranacea.
  - Folia: leaves (nominative plural).
  - 4–6-pollicaria: “4–6 pollicaria” = 4–6 pollices = 4–6 inches long; pollex/pollicarius = inch (pollex historically used to indicate thumb/inch). Here supplied as an adjectival measurement: leaves 4–6 inches long.
  - membranacea: membranaceous; thin, membrane-like in texture.
  - Meaning: “Leaves 4–6 inches, membranaceous (thin, paperlike).”

- Flores illis P. Heyneanae minores.
  - Flores: flowers (nominative plural).
  - illis: ablative plural demonstrative = “than those” or “to those” referring to P. Heyneanae leaves/flowers just mentioned.
  - P. Heyneanae: genitive of P. heyneana: “of P. heyneana.”
  - minores: comparative adjective = smaller.
  - Meaning: “The flowers are smaller than those of P. heyneana.”

- Bracteae raro oculo nudo conspicuae.
  - Bracteae: bracts (nominative plural).
  - raro: rarely.
  - oculo nudo: ablative phrase = “to the naked eye.”
  - conspicuae: conspicuous, noticeable.
  - Meaning: “Bracts rarely conspicuous to the naked eye” → bracts are seldom visible without magnification.

- (v.s.)
  - abbreviation commonly used in herbarium/book contexts: v.s. = “vide siccum” or “v.s.” sometimes rendered as v.s. = “vivae speciminis / vidit sicc.” Usage varies; in Candolle and many 19th c. works, “v.s.” often stands for “vidi siccum” or “visum” meaning “I have seen (the specimen)” or “saw the specimen” — i.e., author saw the specimen. Alternative interpretations include “vidi siccum” = “I have seen the dried specimen.” In context it signals the author’s verification by specimen observation.

Short grammatical and botanical notes (helpful cross‑reference)
- Latin botanical descriptions stack adjectives in ablative or nominative to indicate “with X” (ablative absolute or ablative of description) or “leaves are X” (nominative). Here the entry uses a series of ablative and nominative adjectives to compactly describe characters.
- Terms of texture: membranacea = membranaceous (thin), pubescens/pub eruli/glabratus = hairiness spectrum (pubescent → minutely hairy → glabrous).
- Inflorescence vocabulary: verticillastris (verticillaster), spicatis (spicate, spike-like), paniculatis (paniculate) — combined to convey a complex, interrupted spike-like panicle composed of verticillasters.
- Collector/herbarium abbreviations: Hook. (Hooker), Griff. (Griffith) — exclamation marks indicate specimens examined or authenticated by those collectors/herbaria in the author’s view.
- Measurement: pollicaria (pollices) used for inches; 4–6 pollices = c. 10–15 cm (approx.) but the entry preserves imperial measurement.

If you want, I can:
- produce a literal word‑for‑word gloss line beneath the original Latin;
- render a modern annotated translation into precise English suitable for archival metadata;
- map the historical collector abbreviations to full collector/herbarium names and supply likely herbarium codes and specimen citations.
