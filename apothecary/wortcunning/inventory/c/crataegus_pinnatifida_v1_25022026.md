# Crataegus pinnatifida #

**Crataegus pinnatifida: I have the sliced dried berry, what can I do with it?**

You can treat sliced dried Crataegus pinnatifida (shan zha / Chinese hawthorn) much like other tart dried fruits, with some TCM‑specific twists. [1][2][3]

## Quick everyday uses

- **Tea / decoction:** Simmer 5–10 g of the dried slices in about 500 ml water for 10–20 minutes, then strain and drink; you can blend with chrysanthemum, rose, or a bit of licorice root for balance. [2][7][9]
- Snack add‑in: Soak briefly to soften, then chop and add to porridge, muesli, trail mix, or granola bars; the sourness works like dried cranberries. [3][8]
- Infused water: Cold‑infuse a small handful in a bottle of water in the fridge overnight for a lightly sour “haw water.” [8]

## Sweet dishes

- Compotes and jams: Simmer rehydrated slices with apple or pear, a bit of sugar or honey, and strain if you want a smoother sauce; traditional sweets like haw flakes and haw rolls are essentially concentrated haw syrup or paste. [1][3][6]
- Baking: Fold chopped rehydrated slices into muffins, quick breads, or oatmeal cookies instead of some of the raisins, especially in recipes that already like a tart note. [6][8]
- Jelly / glaze: Because hawthorn has pectin, you can cook it down with sugar and strain to make a jelly or a glossy glaze for cakes and tarts. [1][3][6]

## Savory and condiments

- Sweet‑sour sauce element: Use a hawthorn decoction (reduced tea) instead of some sugar/vinegar in sweet‑and‑sour style sauces; Chinese Cantonese sweet‑sour traditionally used hawthorn. [1]
- Meat braises: Add a small handful to long‑cooked beef, lamb, or pork stews; in Chinese cooking shan zha is often used to help “digest” richer meats and adds gentle acidity. [7][9]
- Chutney‑style relish: Cook with onion, ginger, a chili or two, vinegar, and sugar until thick to make a tart condiment for cheese or roast meats. [3][8]

## Herbal and functional uses

- Simple digestive tea: In TCM, dried shan zha is used as a digestive aid after heavy, fatty meals; a cup of strong tea made from the slices is drunk post‑prandially. [1][7][9]
- Tincture: Macerate the dried slices in 40–50% alcohol (e.g., vodka) for several weeks, then strain; doses are usually small and long‑term, traditionally targeting lipids and circulation, but you’d want to cross‑check with your own references and any meds. [2][3][7][9]

## Practical tips and cautions

- Flavour: Expect **strongly** sour with light sweetness; often best combined with sweeter fruit (apple, pear, dates, raisins). [1][3]
- Seeds: If any seed fragments remain, avoid chewing them deliberately; standard culinary use is to discard seeds when processing into pastes or jellies. [3][6]
- Amounts: For tea/decoction, 5–12 g dried fruit per day is a common traditional range, but if you have cardiovascular meds, blood‑pressure drugs, or are on anticoagulants, treat hawthorn as pharmacologically active and check for interactions. [7][9]

If you tell me what you most enjoy (tea vs sweets vs medicinal prep), I can sketch one or two very concrete, gram‑specific recipes tailored to what you have on hand.
