A coffee bean is actually a dried berry in the mood of a seed isn't it?

A coffee "bean" is botanically not a true bean but rather the seed inside the fruit of the coffee plant. The fruit is classified as a **drupe** (a type of fleshy fruit), specifically called a **coffee cherry** or coffee berry, which dries and contains the seed (the "bean") inside.

### Botanical Facts:
- Coffee belongs to the genus **Coffea** in the family **Rubiaceae**.
- The coffee plant produces small fruits called **drupes** or coffee cherries. These cherries are fleshy berries that typically contain two seeds.
- The seeds inside the dried fruit are what we call "coffee beans."
- Thus, the "coffee bean" is technically the **seed of a dried berry fruit** (drupe) rather than a legume bean.
- Each cherry can contain typically two seeds (coffee beans), but sometimes one seed occurs, called a peaberry.

### Summary

- The **coffee cherry** is a berry-like fruit (a drupe) that encases the seed.
- The "coffee bean" is the seed extracted from this dried berry.
- Therefore, a coffee bean is **botanically a seed**, specifically the seed inside a dried fruit (berry or drupe), and is not a true "bean" as in legumes.

This classification aligns with botanical consensus across Coffea species such as *Coffea arabica* and *Coffea canephora* (Robusta) [1][3][4].

This clearly confirms your understanding: yes, the coffee bean is indeed the dried seed of a berry.
