## Daikon Greens ##

Edibility and flavour
Yes — daikon greens are edible, nutritious, and versatile. They taste like a mustard-green / radish-top hybrid: peppery when raw, mellower and leafy when cooked, and the texture softens with heat.

Traditional and common uses
- Stir-fries and quick sautés — cooked briefly with garlic and soy or sesame to tame any fuzziness and preserve brightness.  
- Soups and stews — added near the end or blanched first so they fold into broths (Japanese kenchin-jiru and many Chinese soups use leafy radish tops)").  
- Furikake and condiments — dried, toasted, crumbled into rice seasoning (a classic Japanese preservation/condiment use).  
- Pickling or quick-pickles — blanched then pickled to add a peppery note to bento and sides").  
- Tempura or fritters — tender leaves battered and fried for a delicate, crisp snack (regional, seasonal usage).

Quick cooking protocols
- Quick stir-fry: wash, trim stems, chop; high heat, 1 tbsp oil, 1–2 garlic cloves, stir 1–2 minutes; finish with soy or a splash of rice wine or sesame oil.  
- Blanch-and-shock for salads: 20–40 seconds in boiling salted water, plunge into iced water, squeeze, dress with sesame, soy, or vinaigrette").  
- Furikake: blanch, squeeze dry, finely chop, toast lightly in pan, combine with sesame, bonito or nori flakes, salt; dry and store.

Storage and selection
Choose bright, unblemished leaves attached to firm daikon roots. Use within 2–3 days for best texture; store wrapped in a damp cloth inside the fridge to slow wilting.

Kitchen-note for your archive
- Shelf role: Greens make efficient, flavourful extensions of the root — think of them as a leaf mustard to be used fresh or preserved.  
- Failure modes: Overcooking makes them bitter and mushy; underwashing leaves grit. Quick heat or blanching preserves flavour and colour.
