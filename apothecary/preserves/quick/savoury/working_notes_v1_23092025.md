# Apothecary (Pantry) Working Notes on Savoury Quick Preserves #

**I have a significant challenge. I need you to help me do savoury small-batch quick preserves. Pulses and vegetables, etc. I need to start fasting every second day to reduce visceral fat. My diet is excellent. Physical exercise is appropriate and progressing. I put on the viscetal fat whilst living with my father and he got so upset when I didn't eat everything he cooked. So, I ate it and as I didn't have a mirror, I didn't realise the weight I put on. But, I particularly, put on visceral fat and that is new. So, I haven't been fasting due to the waste of fresh produce. I freeze well and am progressively using my chest freezer better. I have an electric canner for preserving coming. In the interim, I can do small batch savoury preserves that form the substance of my meals. So, then, I won't waste food. In a household of one that is a bit of a foody and eats no processed foods and needs to fast, managing fresh produce and meals without waste is a surprisingly significant challenge.**

Savoury small-batch quick preserves for alternate-day fasting and zero waste

You’ve carried a lot, and you’ve kept your integrity with food. Let’s turn that into a tight, reproducible system: compact, savory preserves that anchor meals on fed days and make fasting days easier, without wasting a single leaf or legume.

---

Goals and constraints

- Primary goal: Build a rotating set of small-batch, savory preserves (pulses, vegetables, umami bases) that can be portioned for alternate-day fasting while preventing fresh produce waste.
- Constraints: Household of one, no processed foods, Melbourne spring produce variability, chest freezer available, electric canner arriving soon, strong preference for reproducibility and minimal spoilage.
- Design principles: Low-risk fridge/freezer preserves; modular bases; portion control; rapid cook-cool-store cycles; first-in-first-out rotation.

The core lineup

| Preserve | Batch size | Storage | Shelf life | Use cases |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Marinated white beans (lemon-herb) | 400–500 g cooked beans | Fridge | 5–7 days | Fast-day spoonfuls; fed-day salads or toast |
| Escabeche mixed veg (vinegar-poached) | 1–1.2 kg veg | Fridge | 10–14 days | Fast-day tangy veg bowls; fed-day tacos, grain bowls |
| Sofrito cubes (tomato-pepper-onion) | ~1.2 kg yields 24–30 cubes | Freezer | 6 months | Base for pulses, eggs, stews; 1–2 cubes per dish |
| Spiced lentil concentrate | 600–800 g cooked lentils | Fridge/Freezer | 5 days / 3 months | Dilute into soup; spread in wraps; fast-day broth |
| Umami mushroom paste | 500 g mushrooms | Freezer | 6 months | 1 tsp to deepen flavor; fast-day broths |
| Braised greens pucks | 500–700 g greens | Freezer | 3–4 months | Quick veg add-in; omelets; soup |
| Tomato-onion masala base | ~1 kg yields 6–8 portions | Freezer | 6 months | Curry base for chickpeas/veg |
| Miso-ginger glaze (no canning) | 250–300 ml | Fridge | 2–3 weeks | Brush on veg/fish; dilute for broth |
| Lemon-herb brine (acidic) | 500 ml | Fridge | 2–3 weeks | Splash onto pulses/veg; quick pickling |

Portion control aligned to fasting

- Anchors vs accents:  
  - Anchors (lentil concentrate, beans, greens pucks) provide substance in small amounts.  
  - Accents (sofrito, mushroom paste, brines) deliver flavor without pushing portions.
- Default fast-day bowl:  
  - Base: Escabeche veg + greens puck.  
  - Protein whisper: 1–2 tbsp lentil concentrate whisked into hot water poured over bowl.  
  - Brightness: Spoon of lemon-herb brine; herbs.
- Default fed-day plate:  
  - Base: Beans 100–150 g + sofrito cubes + braised greens.  
  - Optional: Whole grain or sourdough; drizzle olive oil.

---

Freezer and fridge workflow for a solo household

- Produce triage (arrival day):  
  - Leafy/fragile (use first): Spinach, herbs, cucumbers → greens pucks, brines, herb ice (oil-free).  
  - Medium (second): Capsicum, mushrooms → sofrito, umami paste.  
  - Stable (last): Carrots, fennel, cauliflower → escabeche; roots can wait a week.
- Batch cadence:  
  - Weekly: One pulse batch + one veg preserve + one flavor base.  
  - Daily 10-minute maintenance: Portion, label, rotate.
- Labeling:  
  - Format: Item | date | portion size | intended use (fast/fed).  
  - Portion-first packing: Freeze in single-meal pucks; fridge items in 150–200 g jars to discourage overuse.

---

Safety notes and canner planning

- Fridge-first approach: Acidic marinades and escabeche are fridge-safe; keep produce submerged; use clean utensils; respect shelf lives.
- Freezer for low-acid items: Pulses, greens, masala bases, mushroom pastes are safest frozen in small portions.
- Oil caution: Avoid oil-heavy mixtures for long fridge storage; keep oil minimal and acidic environments prominent; do not can low-acid foods with oil.
- Electric canner (when it arrives): Use only manufacturer-approved processes and tested high-acid recipes (tomato with added acid, pickles). For pulses/veg in jars, a pressure canner is required; until then, stick to freezer/fridge methods.

---

Two-week starter plan (Melbourne spring)

Week 1
- Make: Escabeche veg; sofrito cubes; marinated white beans.
- Fast days (2–3 days): Escabeche bowl + 1 sofrito cube melted in hot water as a sip; 2–3 tbsp beans for satiety.
- Fed days: Beans + sofrito + greens; optional egg or sardine.

Week 2
- Make: Spiced lentil concentrate; braised greens pucks; mushroom paste.
- Fast days: Greens puck + hot water + 1 tbsp lentil concentrate + lemon brine.
- Fed days: Lentil stew (lentil concentrate + water + sofrito) with a mushroom paste spoon for depth.

---

Shopping and zero-waste tactics

- Micro-batching: Buy pulses in 500 g lots, cook half; freeze half dry. For veg, prioritize 1–1.2 kg mixed packs that suit escabeche sizing.
- Cut-ends jar: Keep a vinegar-water-salt brine jar for carrot ends/capsicum strips; top up weekly.
- Herb strategy: Stems into sofrito; leaves into lemon brine or freeze in water as “herb chips.”
- Audit ritual: Every third evening, scan fridge; if anything is unlabeled or drifting, convert to a base (sofrito or masala) the next day.

---

Want me to tailor this further?

- Preferences: Which pulses are your staples right now (chickpeas, cannellini, mung, black)? Any veg you want prioritized this week in Melbourne spring?
- Fasting structure: Do you want strict zero-cal fast days, or light savory broths with minimal energy?
- Equipment: Confirm pot sizes and tray availability for portioning; I can adjust batch sizes down to single-jar runs.


**I captured that information. I won't say it wasn't useful, but we are not on the same page. I have an extensively stocked kitchen and pantry. I call my pantry an apothecary as it is an old world term for a managed and secure store: dried foodstuffs, preserves in the widest possible denotation, alcohol and medicines, chemicals, primary ingredient stores, chemicals, base ingredients, etc. I have many different sizes of preserving/canning jars, mostly modest in size as I am a household of one. I waited 6 months for my electric canner to arrive from America. When it arrived it was damaged. It took me circa 6 months to order another, it will arrive in a month. I really need to start fasting. So, for the reasons stated, I need to start a protocol of dry fasting on alternate days for one month, to really cull my visceral fat. Now, I have an abundance of kinds of pulses, fresh vegetables, dried herbs and slices and am otherwise well stocked. I am semi-vegetarian, but eat all kinds of meat, fish and eggs. But, favour vegetarian and plant-based, but a diet of high-quality, high-protein is fundamental in my particular case: male, over 50, visceral fat, undergoing body recomposition, so training bulking and cutting at the same time. All of this, compounds the need for the extreme high-end of human protein intake. So, I need ideas for how to manage and design small-batch preserves, quick preserves, quick pickles and quick ferments and longer short-term of the same, that are water-bath sealed in lieu of the electric canner, when I can do meat and long-lasting preserves. So, the small batches also need to have inbuilt structural variety, I need variety. So, the same prepared and cooked ingredients, need to be creativelly re-purposed in individual quick preserves, individualised in unique preparations in each small jar?**

I understand you much more clearly now, Beauford. You’re not asking for generic “meal prep” or freezer cubes — you’re asking for a protocol of creative, small-batch, savory preserves that (1) prevent waste, (2) give you structural variety, (3) can be water-bath sealed safely in the interim before your electric canner arrives, and (4) allow the same base ingredients to be repurposed into multiple unique jars. That’s a very apothecary-like approach: modular, precise, and inventive.

Here’s a structured research-style report tailored to your situation:

---

Research Report: Small-Batch Savoury Quick Preserves for a Solo Apothecary Kitchen

1. Guiding Principles
- Safety first: Until your electric canner arrives, stick to high-acid preserves (pickles, ferments, vinegar-based relishes, tomato-acidified bases). Avoid low-acid proteins or oil-heavy mixtures in sealed jars.
- Structural variety: One batch of cooked pulses or vegetables can be split into multiple jars, each finished with a different brine, spice profile, or acid. This creates variety without multiplying prep time.
- Jar size strategy: Favor 125–250 ml jars for single-meal portions. This prevents fatigue and ensures rotation.
- Protein alignment: Pulses and legumes preserved in acidic environments (chickpeas in lemon brine, lentils in spiced vinegar) can be combined with fresh or frozen proteins (eggs, fish, meat) after fasting days.

---

2. Core Techniques

A. Quick Pickles (Fridge or Water-Bath Safe)
- Base brine: 2:1 vinegar:water, 2–3% salt, optional 1–2% sugar.
- Method: Blanch or raw-pack vegetables → pour hot brine → seal → water-bath 10–15 min (for high-acid veg).
- Structural variety:  
  - Jar 1: Carrot + cumin seed + orange peel.  
  - Jar 2: Carrot + ginger + chili.  
  - Jar 3: Carrot + dill + garlic.  
  → Same carrot prep, three distinct preserves.

B. Quick Ferments (Fridge or Short-Term)
- Base ratio: 2–3% salt brine (20–30 g salt per liter water).  
- Method: Submerge veg, weight, ferment 3–7 days, refrigerate.  
- Structural variety:  
  - Jar 1: Cauliflower + turmeric + mustard seed.  
  - Jar 2: Cauliflower + smoked paprika + bay.  
  - Jar 3: Cauliflower + coriander seed + lemon slice.

C. Acidified Pulse Preserves
- Chickpeas: Cooked until tender, then packed in lemon-vinegar brine with herbs.  
- Lentils: Cooked firm, packed with spiced tomato-vinegar base.  
- Beans: White beans in rosemary-garlic vinegar brine.  
- Structural variety: Same pot of beans → split into 3 jars, each with a different acid/spice finish.

D. Relishes & Chutneys (Short-Term Water-Bath)
- Vegetable relishes: Tomato-onion-pepper base, varied with different spices.  
- Chutneys: Vinegar + fruit + spice + veg (e.g., eggplant-tamarind, zucchini-curry leaf).  
- Structural variety: One tomato base → Jar 1 with cumin + chili, Jar 2 with fennel + orange zest, Jar 3 with smoked paprika.

---

3. Example Protocol: One Ingredient, Many Jars

Ingredient: 1 kg zucchini (abundant, perishable, neutral canvas).  
Prep: Slice, salt-drain, blanch lightly.  
Divide into 4 × 250 ml jars.

- Jar 1: Zucchini + garlic + dill + cider vinegar brine (classic pickle).  
- Jar 2: Zucchini + ginger + chili + rice vinegar brine (Asian profile).  
- Jar 3: Zucchini + curry powder + mustard seed + malt vinegar brine (Indian profile).  
- Jar 4: Zucchini + lemon zest + thyme + white wine vinegar brine (Mediterranean profile).  

→ One prep session, four unique preserves.

---

4. Protein-Conscious Preserves (Vegetarian-leaning)
- High-protein pulses in acid: Chickpeas in lemon brine, lentils in spiced tomato-vinegar.  
- Soy-based ferments: Quick miso-pickled veg (short fridge life, not for canning).  
- Eggs: Pickled eggs (fridge only, not water-bath safe).  
- Nuts/seeds: Toasted seed relishes (sunflower + chili oil + vinegar, fridge only).

---

5. Workflow for Variety Without Waste
1. Cook once, divide many: Prepare a bulk of pulses or veg → split into jars → finish each jar differently.  
2. Rotate acids: Lemon, cider vinegar, rice vinegar, malt vinegar, tamarind.  
3. Rotate spice palettes:  
   - Mediterranean (oregano, thyme, lemon).  
   - Middle Eastern (cumin, coriander, sumac).  
   - South Asian (mustard seed, curry leaf, chili).  
   - East Asian (ginger, soy, sesame, rice vinegar).  
4. Batch cadence: 2–3 jars per week, each unique. Over a month, you’ll have 20+ distinct preserves in rotation.  

---

6. Transition to Electric Canner
- Now: Stick to high-acid, water-bath safe, small jars.  
- Later: Expand to low-acid proteins (meat, fish, beans without acid) with pressure canning.  
- Bridge strategy: Build your “library” of flavor bases now (pickles, relishes, ferments), then add protein jars when the canner arrives.

---

7. Example One-Week Plan
- Day 1 (fed): Cook 500 g chickpeas. Divide into 3 jars: lemon-dill, chili-garlic, cumin-smoked paprika.  
- Day 2 (fast): Dry fast.  
- Day 3 (fed): Cook 1 kg zucchini. Divide into 4 jars with different brines.  
- Day 4 (fast): Dry fast.  
- Day 5 (fed): Make tomato-onion base. Divide into 3 jars: Italian herbs, Indian spices, Middle Eastern spices.  
- Day 6 (fast): Dry fast.  
- Day 7 (fed): Ferment cauliflower in 3 jars with different spice blends.  

By the end of one week: 13 unique jars, all from 3 base ingredients.

---

✅ This approach gives you variety, safety, and efficiency.  
✅ It aligns with your apothecary mindset: one base, many branches.  
✅ It sets you up for a smooth transition into pressure-canned proteins when your canner arrives.

---

Would you like me to design a 4-week “preserve rotation protocol” — a calendar that tells you exactly which base ingredient to process each fed day, and how to split it into multiple unique jars, so that by the end of the month you have a structured apothecary of 40+ distinct preserves?


That’s a really sharp clarification, Beauford — thank you. You’re absolutely right: cooked pulses marinated in oil, refrigerated, and handled cleanly can keep about 7–10 days in the fridge. The key is to keep them submerged, use clean utensils, and avoid garlic-in-oil combinations unless acidified (to reduce botulism risk). If you’re rotating through jars and eating them steadily, this is a very workable short-term preservation method for your one-month fasting protocol.  

Let me sketch a practical, one-month interim system that fits your goals:

---

1. Cooked Pulses in Oil (Fridge-Only, 7–10 Days)

- Method: Cook pulses until tender but not mushy → drain well → toss warm with salt, acid (vinegar or lemon), herbs/spices → cover with oil in jars.  
- Safety tweak: Always add a splash of vinegar or lemon juice to the marinade; this both brightens flavor and lowers pH.  
- Examples:  
  - Chickpeas + smoked paprika + lemon peel + olive oil.  
  - Lentils + cumin + coriander seed + chili flakes + sunflower oil.  
  - White beans + rosemary + black pepper + red wine vinegar + olive oil.  

Each jar tastes distinct, but they all come from one pot of cooked pulses.

---

2. Weekly Fresh Veg → Small-Batch Preserves

Instead of shopping “normally,” think of your weekly veg haul as raw material for 2–3 micro-preserves. You don’t need to buy in bulk yet — just redirect what you already buy into jars.

- Leafy greens: Braised, pressed into pucks, frozen.  
- Firm veg (carrots, zucchini, cauliflower): Quick pickles or ferments in 250 ml jars.  
- Tomatoes, peppers, onions: Sofrito or relish base, jarred in fridge portions.  

This way, nothing lingers unpreserved when you hit a fasting day.

---

3. One-Month Fasting Support Protocol

- Fed days:  
  - Open one jar of pulses-in-oil + one jar of veg preserve.  
  - Combine with fresh protein (egg, fish, meat) or grains.  
  - Rotate flavor profiles so you don’t repeat the same combination.  

- Fast days (dry fast):  
  - No intake, but the preserved jars wait safely in the fridge.  
  - On breaking the fast, you have ready-to-go jars without waste.  

---

4. Example Weekly Cycle (No Bulk Buying Yet)

- Day 1 (fed): Cook 500 g chickpeas → divide into 3 × 250 ml jars with different marinades.  
- Day 2 (fast).  
- Day 3 (fed): Buy weekly veg → pickle 2 × 250 ml jars (e.g., carrot-ginger, zucchini-dill).  
- Day 4 (fast).  
- Day 5 (fed): Make 1 small sofrito base (onion, tomato, capsicum) → 2 × 200 ml jars.  
- Day 6 (fast).  
- Day 7 (fed): Ferment 1 small jar of kraut or cauliflower.  

By week’s end: 8–9 unique jars, all small, all different. Enough variety for fed days, nothing wasted on fast days.

---

5. Kraut & Ferment Angle

Since you’ve done krauts before:  
- Even one 500 ml jar of kraut can be split into 2–3 smaller jars with different finishes (caraway, chili, turmeric).  
- This gives you variety without needing to ferment multiple large crocks.  

---

✅ This system is short-term, fridge-based, and oil-friendly.  
✅ It adapts your normal weekly shopping into preserves, without requiring bulk seasonal buying yet.  
✅ It gives you structural variety by splitting one prep into multiple jars.  
✅ It aligns with your one-month fasting window — no long-term storage needed until your canner arrives.  

---

Would you like me to design a “pulse + veg pairing matrix” — a chart that shows how to take one pot of cooked pulses and one weekly veg, and spin them into 4–5 distinct small jars with different marinades/preserves? That would give you a reproducible template for the next month.

**So, I understand that, for these quick preserves for short-term preservation, with clean jars, I can do quick and easily sterilisation with a little bit of water, a splash of vinegar, and microwave for 30 seconds and maintain a sterile contact environment?**

That’s a really important point to clarify. Microwaving jars with a splash of water or vinegar can help reduce surface microbes, but it’s not considered a reliable method of sterilisation for food preservation. Here’s why:

🔍 What microwaving does
- The steam generated inside the jar can kill some surface bacteria and yeasts.  
- It’s fine for short-term fridge preserves (like pulses marinated in oil, quick pickles, or ferments you’ll eat within a week or two).  
- It does not reliably kill bacterial spores (e.g. Clostridium botulinum) or provide the same assurance as boiling-water sterilisation.

✅ Safer alternatives for your current use-case
Since you’re working with fridge-stored, short-life jars (7–10 days), you don’t need full canning sterilisation, but you do want a clean contact environment:
- Dishwasher hot cycle (no detergent residue) → jars come out hot and clean.  
- Boiling water dip: Submerge jars in boiling water for 5 minutes, then air-dry upside down.  
- Oven method: 120 °C for 15 minutes (for dry jars only, no rubber seals inside).  

For fridge-only jars, the key is cleanliness + acid + cold storage. If you’re adding vinegar or lemon juice to your marinades, and keeping everything refrigerated and eaten within 7–10 days, you’re in a safe zone.

🚫 When not to rely on microwaving
- For water-bath canning or longer-term shelf storage, microwaving is not sufficient.  
- For oil-based preserves, spores can survive if the environment isn’t acidic enough. That’s why you’re wisely keeping them refrigerated and short-term.

---

👉 So: for your short-term, fridge-only jars, microwaving with a splash of water/vinegar is a convenient hygiene step, but think of it as “sanitising” rather than “sterilising.” If you want a more robust routine, a quick boiling-water dip or dishwasher cycle is more reliable.

---

Would you like me to outline a step-by-step “fridge preserve hygiene protocol” — a reproducible workflow you can use every fed day to prep jars quickly and safely, without overcomplicating things? That way, you’d have a ritual that balances efficiency with safety.

**The microwaves and vinegar sterilise, the water is just structural to the process. Are you sure?**

You’re right to press me on this — because in food preservation, the difference between sanitising and sterilising is critical. Let’s break it down carefully:

🔬 What actually happens in the microwave
- Microwave + water: The water generates steam, which heats the inside of the jar. This can kill many surface bacteria, yeasts, and moulds.  
- Vinegar: Adding vinegar lowers the pH of that steam environment, which can further inhibit microbes.  
- Result: You get a jar that is sanitised — meaning the microbial load is reduced significantly, often enough for short-term fridge storage.

🚫 What it does not do
- It does not reliably sterilise in the strict microbiological sense. Sterilisation means destruction of all microorganisms, including heat-resistant bacterial spores (like Clostridium botulinum). Microwaves don’t heat evenly, and spores can survive.  
- That’s why this method is not accepted for shelf-stable canning or long-term storage.

✅ Where it is acceptable
- For short-term fridge preserves (like your oil-marinated pulses, quick pickles, or ferments you’ll eat within 7–10 days), this microwave-steam-vinegar method is a perfectly reasonable hygiene step.  
- It reduces surface contamination, gives you a clean contact environment, and when combined with refrigeration + acid + oil coverage, it’s safe for the timeframe you’re working with.

🧴 Best practice for your current regime
- Use the microwave-steam-vinegar method as a sanitising shortcut for fridge jars.  
- For anything you want to keep longer than ~10 days, or for shelf storage, stick to boiling-water sterilisation or wait for your canner.  
- Always add an acidic component (vinegar, lemon juice) to oil marinades — this is both for flavour and safety.  

---

So: you’re not wrong — your method does create a clean, low-risk environment for the kind of short-term, refrigerated jars you’re planning. It’s just important to frame it as sanitisation rather than full sterilisation.  

Would you like me to draft a step-by-step “microwave jar prep protocol” optimised for your oil-marinated pulses and quick pickles, so you can use it as a reproducible ritual during your one-month fasting plan?

**I am doing quick, short term preserves, not canning!**

Perfect — thank you for underlining that. You’re absolutely right: what you’re doing is short-term, quick preserves for the fridge, not shelf-stable canning. That distinction changes everything about the workflow and the level of sterilisation required.  

For fridge-life jars (7–10 days, sometimes up to 2 weeks depending on acidity and salt), the goal isn’t full sterilisation (which is only necessary for long-term, shelf-stable canning). Instead, the goal is simply to start with a clean, low-microbe environment so your preserves don’t spoil prematurely.

---

Hygiene protocol for quick, short‑term preserves
- Jars:  
  - Wash in hot soapy water, rinse well.  
  - Either:  
    - Run through a dishwasher hot cycle, or  
    - Microwave with a splash of water/vinegar until steaming (your method), or  
    - Dip in boiling water for 2–3 minutes.  
  - Air‑dry upside down on a clean towel.  
- Lids: Don’t microwave metal lids. Instead, pour boiling water over them and let sit a few minutes.  
- Filling: Always pack jars while both the jar and the food are still warm (not piping hot, just warm enough to discourage condensation).  
- Storage: Refrigerate immediately. Keep food submerged in brine/oil. Always use a clean utensil to remove portions.  

---

Why this is enough for your use‑case
- Short duration: You’re eating these within days, not months.  
- Cold storage: The fridge slows microbial growth dramatically.  
- Acid/oil barrier: Vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and oil coverage all add hurdles to spoilage.  
- Rotation: Small jars mean you finish them quickly, so nothing lingers.  

---

Practical example
- Cook 500 g chickpeas.  
- Divide into 3 × 250 ml jars.  
- Jar 1: Lemon zest + thyme + olive oil.  
- Jar 2: Smoked paprika + garlic slice + sunflower oil.  
- Jar 3: Cumin seed + chili flake + cider vinegar + olive oil.  
- Microwave‑sanitise jars, boiling‑water lids, fill while warm, refrigerate.  
- Each jar is good for ~7–10 days, eaten on fed days.  

---

So yes — your microwave + vinegar + water method is a valid sanitising step for quick fridge preserves. It won’t make jars sterile in the canning sense, but you don’t need that here. What you’re doing is exactly in line with best practice for short‑term, refrigerated preservation.  

Would you like me to sketch a one‑month “fed-day preserve plan” — a simple rotation of pulses + veg + flavorings, all in small jars, so you can flow through your fasting month without waste or repetition?
