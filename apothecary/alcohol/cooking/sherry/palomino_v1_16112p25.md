# Palomino: Dry Cooking Sherry ~ An Introduction #

So, what is the first attestation of the term?

The first attestations of the term "Palomino" for the horse and the grape are as follows:

### Palomino Horse
- The term "Palomino" horse was officially recognized in the 20th century with formal registries beginning in the United States in 1932 and 1935. The Palomino Horse Association was incorporated in 1936, continuing the registry started in 1935 when Dick Halliday registered the golden stallion El Rey de los Reyes[1][2].
- Historically, palomino-colored horses appear in ancient tapestries, paintings, and artworks from Europe, Asia, Chinese, and Japanese art, suggesting the color has been admired for centuries[3][4].
- There are legendary and historical ties to Spanish royalty, especially Queen Isabella I of Spain in the late 15th century, who reportedly favored such golden-colored horses and sent them to the Americas in the 1500s, thus popularizing the color name[3][2][5].

### Palomino Grape
- The Palomino grape, especially known as Palomino Fino, has been cultivated in southern Spain, particularly Andalusia, since at least the Middle Ages, making it a centuries-old varietal. It might have Greek or Mediterranean origins predating Spanish cultivation[6][7].
- The grape's name is traditionally linked to a knight named Fernán Palomino who served King Alfonso X of Castile in the 13th century during the Reconquista; the grape supposedly received its name from this historical figure[6][7][8].
- Its use and reputation became well established in sherry production, with history tracing the variety's prominence at least as far back as medieval Spain[9][7].

### Summary
- The horse's recorded use of "Palomino" as a color/name emerges concretely in the early 20th century registries but has artistic and legendary antecedents centuries earlier.
- The grape's name has medieval attestations linked to the 13th century, rooted in Spanish history and viticulture.
- Both names, reflecting golden/yellow coloration, arise independently in different contexts but share a historical connection to Spain and a cultural appreciation for the golden color.

This gives the earliest attestations as medieval for the grape (13th century) and early 20th-century formal records for the horse, although color references for the horse appear much earlier in art and lore [1][6][3][7][2][8].
