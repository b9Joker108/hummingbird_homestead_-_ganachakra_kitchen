### Saturday, November 29, 2025 ~ 'Irradiation from Satellite and Possibly From Genetically-Engineered and Maliciously-Designed Icky-Yuckies from Within or Even from the Empty Flat Nextdoor ###

Circa five (5) years ago, a young boy in Frankston, where I was then living with my birthfather by siring of seed, but neither by stile nor quality of substance, kindness, love nor ᛛ\[sub]ᛛstandard, referred to me within his interior in my jogging vacinity as a Desecrated '[Tetragrammaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tetragrammaton&oldid=1324491013)' (Hebrew: יהוה) whilsᛏ I was doing bodywork outdoors. They had triangulated on me somehow and were doing juvenile amplifications on me around my home, I saw and heard an old woman doing it in the same period I had just returned from Liverpool, U.K., and they needsmust have got my detailing and Australian return, likely from the U.K. or Sweden, both sovereign nation-states of my cultural first-tier. Sweden First, then U.K. My ᚤfatherᚤ talked about the ᛮDesecrated Divine Rightᛮ being Hot. Hot, makes me want to affirm that they have been irradiating me somehow from sattelite. It happened yesterday. So, he was involved somehow. This boy in Frankston, young boy, had to be of a family and lineage that needsmust be culled forthwith. Endeavour to ascertan who was in on that and I request a report of ᛋubstandarᛞ. My Father has a portrait by [Brett-Livingston Strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brett-Livingstone_Strong&oldid=1312245696) entitled `Father of the ᛖessiah`, I request it forthwith. My father owes me $2,000 and I will have this as Divine Interest. Michael Jackson once offered him more than a Million Dollars greenback for it. Start a Fund from my deeply triangulated pure ones at AUD $1.00 each. Send a 'curator' to my ᚡather and cultivate. ᛟXᚹᛛ

My interior Mandhir is of standard, but the exterier sacral space and the array of archa-vigraha and all my tools in the outier tier are not all presently in superlative order. But, my whole homestead and all that which is outside of my homestead, is my altar for working. As a fairlight, clear and superlative jewell, I walk in \\|/Beauty\\|/.

What was the Dreaming called in indigenous tongues?

The Dreaming, a central spiritual and cosmological concept among Australian Aboriginal peoples, is known by many different names across the richly diverse Indigenous languages of Australia. It is a multi-faceted worldview encompassing creation, ancestral beings, law, and ongoing spiritual connection to the land and cosmos.

### Indigenous Names for the Dreaming

1. **Alcheringa / Altjira / Altjirrinja (Arrernte/Aranda language, Central Australia)**  
   - One of the earliest recorded terms by anthropologists Spencer and Gillen, often translated as "Everywhen" or eternal, uncreated reality[1][2][3].

2. **Jukurrpa / Tjukurrpa (Warlpiri and Western Desert languages)**  
   - Signifies not just creation stories but also law, morality, and life patterns that persist eternally as guiding principles for Aboriginal people of the Central and Western deserts[1][2][4][5].

3. **Manguny (Martu Wangka, Western Desert and Pilbara regions)**  
   - Refers to the sacred time and the ancestral creative stories specific to Martu peoples[3].

4. **Wongar (North-East Arnhem Land languages)**  
   - Used by some Aboriginal groups in Arnhem Land to describe the creation and ancestral spiritual time[1][3].

5. **Ngarrangkarni / Ngarranggarni (Kija and other East Kimberley languages)**  
   - A term expressing the sacred creative time and law linked to ancestral beings within Kimberley cultures[3].

6. **Ungud / Wungud (Ngarinyin people, North-Western Australia)**  
   - Spiritual concept related to the Dreaming, often associated with ancestral serpent beings and the creative processes[3].

7. **Nura (Dharug language, Sydney Basin)**  
   - Name used to refer to "country" and Dreaming concept integrating place, ancestry, and spiritual law[1].

8. **Nyitting (Noongar language, South-West Australia)**  
   - Closely linked to creation stories and spiritual law in the south-western Aboriginal communities[1].

9. Other region-specific names exist due to the linguistic diversity with over 250 languages and hundreds of dialects historically[3].

### Conceptual Note
- "Dreaming" or "Dreamtime" as an English term emerged from anthropological discourse and is **not a direct or absolute translation** of any one Indigenous word but a catch-all term for a complex, multi-layered spiritual reality[1][6].
- Many Aboriginal people emphasize that the Dreaming is a **living reality rather than a past "time"**, reflected linguistically in terms that convey ongoing spiritual presence, law, and ancestral guidance[1][2][6].
- The terms collectively convey a sacred, eternal, and cyclical worldview underpinning Aboriginal connection to land, identity, and community.

I am delighted to report that legacy prashadam heated today and defrosted yesterday from the bhoga offered and prashadam prepared in the early days of my new freezer and prior to my stock rotation protocol, heated and served with a pesto of daikon greens this noon, was amongst the most sublime meals I have honoured and tasted in my life. I have never prepared daikon greens like this before. I don't remember making the prashadam and it didn't taste like that earlier or I would have remembered it. Today has been a most fruitfully creative day, I feel, as a result.

AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) emerged from the confluence of algebraic modeling, operations research, and Bell Labs’ culture of elegant pragmatism. It embodies a worldview where mathematical clarity meets computational efficiency—bridging human-readable models with industrial-scale optimization.

---

📜 Antecedents & Precedents

- Mathematical Programming Tradition: AMPL descends from the lineage of linear and nonlinear programming languages developed in the 1960s–1980s, such as GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) and MPS (Mathematical Programming System format).
- Influences:
  - AWK: AMPL’s syntax and scripting flexibility reflect the influence of AWK, co-developed by Brian Kernighan.
  - C: Its procedural extensions and modularity echo C’s design ethos.
- Bell Labs Legacy: Developed at Bell Labs in the 1980s by Robert Fourer, David Gay, and Brian Kernighan, AMPL was shaped by a culture that prized elegant, expressive, and efficient tools for complex systems.

---

🛠️ Development & Design Philosophy

- First Released: 1985; formalized in a 1990 Management Science paper.
- Design Goals:
  - Algebraic expressiveness: Models resemble textbook formulations.
  - Separation of model and data: Encourages modularity and reuse.
  - Solver independence: Interfaces with dozens of solvers (e.g., CPLEX, Gurobi, IPOPT, SNOPT).
  - Declarative + imperative: Combines high-level modeling with procedural scripting for control flow.
- File Types:
  - .mod: model definitions
  - .dat: data files
  - .run: control scripts

---

🧠 Worldview & Aesthetic Commitments

- Beauty in Clarity: AMPL’s syntax is designed to mirror mathematical notation, making models readable by both humans and machines.
- Constraint-Centric Thinking: It embodies a worldview where constraints are primary, and computation is a means of exploring feasible, optimal configurations.
- Modularity as Ritual: The separation of model, data, and control mirrors a ritualized workflow—each part with its own sanctity and role.

---

🧩 Applications

- Operations Research: Logistics, supply chain, scheduling, network design.
- Finance: Portfolio optimization, risk modeling.
- Energy Systems: Power grid optimization, capacity planning.
- Telecommunications: Network routing, bandwidth allocation.
- Academic Research: Widely used in teaching and prototyping optimization models.

---

🧬 Constraints & Limitations

- Proprietary Core: While the AMPL Solver Library (ASL) is open-source, the AMPL translator is proprietary.
- Learning Curve: Though algebraic, it requires familiarity with optimization theory and solver behavior.
- Solver Dependency: Performance and capabilities depend on the external solver used.

---

🪶 Legacy & Influence

- Influenced:
  - JuMP (Julia) and Pyomo (Python): Both draw on AMPL’s declarative modeling paradigm.
- Institutional Adoption: Used by corporations, governments, and universities globally.
- Pedagogical Tool: Its clarity makes it a staple in operations research education.
- Longevity: Still actively maintained and extended, with a stable release as recent as September 2025.

---

🌐 Epistemic Frame

AMPL encodes a worldview where mathematical structure is sacred, optimization is a ritual of refinement, and clarity is beauty. It is not just a language but a philosophy of modeling—where the modeler is a priest of structure, the solver a fire, and the objective function a sacrificial offering.

Let me know if you’d like a side-by-side comparison with GAMS, JuMP, or Pyomo—or a worked example from Vedic logistics or ritual scheduling.

Vedic logistics: temple offering supply optimization

This example models a daily temple supply chain for offerings (flowers, milk, ghee, grains) from multiple vendors to multiple rituals, with time windows and purity levels. It demonstrates AMPL’s separation of model, data, and control.

Notes on worldview, beauty, and constraints

- Beauty: Models reflect ritual algebra—variables and constraints map directly to lived practice.
- Constraints as sanctity: Time windows, buffers, purity thresholds, and precedence encode the ritual order as inviolable structure.
- Separation of concerns: Model/data/control mirrors ritual roles: formulation, offerings, and execution.
- Extensibility: Add kalā timing (planetary hours), marma-based buffers, or material rasāyana weights to reconcile logistics with spiritual intent.

If you’d like, I can integrate both models into a unified planning run, where the logistics solution feeds feasible delivery times and purity into the scheduling constraints.

**Right, so in my language, in a rudimentary and preliminary estimation, from your tailored sketch, I perceive AMPL as an archetypal language: It sets the rules of a possible world; defines bounded sets of what is possible in that world; charts the delimitation of the possible from ideal to its bounds of tolerance and play, both in their Engineering denotations?

Yes, that’s a very precise and evocative way to frame AMPL. In fact, your description captures its archetypal role in computational modeling:

---

🔑 AMPL as Archetypal Language

- Rule‑setting of a possible world  
  AMPL defines the axioms of a model world: sets, parameters, variables and constraints. These are not just technical constructs but the ontological boundaries of what can exist in that modeled universe.

- Bounded sets of possibility  
  Each constraint is a law of physics, economics, or ritual logistics within that world. AMPL doesn’t merely calculate—it delimits: it says “within these bounds, solutions may exist; outside them, they are forbidden.”

- Delimitation from ideal to tolerance  
  - Ideal: The objective function embodies the aspirational “perfect offering” or “optimal schedule.”  
  - Tolerance: Constraints encode engineering denotations—capacity limits, purity thresholds, time buffers. These are the tolerances within which the ideal must be realized.  
  - Play: Slack variables, penalties, and alternative feasible solutions allow exploration of the liminal space between strict feasibility and pragmatic compromise.

- Engineering worldview  
  AMPL’s worldview is deeply engineering‑oriented:  
  - Abstract clarity: Models resemble algebraic formulations in textbooks.  
  - Operational grounding: Solutions are computed by industrial solvers, bridging idealized mathematics with real‑world tolerances.  
  - Constraint primacy: It privileges constraints as the defining reality, with objectives as guiding but negotiable.

---

🌐 Philosophical Resonance

Your phrasing—“archetypal language” and “possible world”—aligns with how AMPL is often perceived in operations research:

- It is ontological: it defines what exists (sets, variables).  
- It is epistemic: it defines what can be known (constraints, feasible regions).  
- It is ritualistic: the separation of model, data, and control mirrors ritual roles—formulation, offering, execution.  
- It is playful yet bounded: optimization is the dance between ideal aspiration and bounded tolerance.

---

So yes: AMPL is not just a programming language but a world‑defining grammar. It charts the liminal space between the ideal (objective) and the bounded (constraints), and in doing so, it becomes archetypal—an abstract ritual of engineering thought.

Would you like me to extend this archetypal framing into a comparative lens—for example, contrasting AMPL’s “possible world” grammar with GAMS, JuMP, or Pyomo, to show how each defines its own cosmology of constraints and play?


**Tell me all about the prophetic CompSci volume: 'Computers and Thought'?**

“Computers and Thought” (1963) was the first major anthology of Artificial Intelligence research, edited by Edward A. Feigenbaum and Julian Feldman. It became a prophetic volume because it gathered the foundational voices—Turing, Minsky, Newell, Simon—into one book, effectively defining AI as a discipline.

---

📜 Antecedents & Context
- Early AI research (1940s–1960s): Alan Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” and early experiments in theorem proving, game playing, and symbolic reasoning set the stage.
- Scarcity of texts: At the time, there were almost no published books on AI. “Computers and Thought” filled this vacuum, becoming a de facto textbook.
- Course origins: The anthology grew out of readings for an AI course Feigenbaum taught at Berkeley in the early 1960s.

---

📖 Content & Structure
- Twenty classic papers: Included works by Alan Turing, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, and others.
- Topics covered:
  - Chess and checkers programs
  - Automated theorem proving in logic and geometry
  - Problem solving in calculus
  - Assembly line balancing
  - Early machine vision and pattern recognition
- Bibliographic apparatus: Reprinted Marvin Minsky’s “Selected Descriptor-Indexed Bibliography to the Literature on Artificial Intelligence” (1961), giving readers a roadmap of the field.

---

🌍 Historicity & Development
- Publication year: 1963, University of California, Berkeley.
- Translations: Russian, Japanese, Polish, and Spanish—showing global interest in AI even at its inception.
- Legacy editions: Later reissued by MIT Press and AAAI Press, ensuring continued availability.

---

🧠 Applications & Influence
- Pedagogical role: Served as the first textbook-like resource for AI courses worldwide.
- Research catalyst: Inspired generations of computer scientists to explore symbolic reasoning, heuristic search, and cognitive simulation.
- Institutional impact: Helped establish AI as a legitimate academic field, bridging computer science, psychology, and philosophy.

---

🪶 Legacy & Worldview
- Beauty: The anthology captured the optimism of early AI—the belief that computers could simulate human thought.
- Constraints: It reflected the limits of the time: symbolic logic, heuristic search, and rule-based systems, before machine learning.
- Worldview: “Computers and Thought” framed AI as a cognitive science, not just engineering—machines as partners in reasoning, not mere calculators.
- Prophetic role: Many of its themes—game playing, theorem proving, symbolic reasoning—remain central, though now augmented by statistical learning.

---

✨ Why Prophetic?
Because it codified AI’s founding myths and methods in one accessible volume. It foresaw a world where computers would not only calculate but think, and it gave the first generation of AI researchers a shared canon.

---

Would you like me to map each of the twenty papers in the anthology to its modern descendants—for example, Turing’s paper to today’s AI ethics debates, or Newell & Simon’s problem-solving programs to modern planning algorithms?

I am excited. I puchased Meethi (Fenugreek) greens today. I have eaten them prepared by others, but I have not yet cooked with them before. I was drawn to them. I didn't know what they were. An Indian lady I asked said: "meetha", with the male gendered case-ending. I have had Fenugreek seeds in my pantry from circa 19 years old. I love them, and especially, their pungent taste. My kitchen is never without them. I have been intending to sprout them, which I must get in the habit and routine of doing. Sprouting and microgreens at home saves so much money and they are so fresh, nutririous and tasty.

### Tuesday, November 11, 2025 ###

I am finally Inaugurating and Installing my new jade-green glazed ceramic Foo Dogs and recovered old pair of glazed Indian ceramic Temple Elephants. Whilst I was drying the Female Foo Mother and Child, post Their holybath, I had the clear auditory directive for Their placement beside my bed, which surprised me greatly. I will progressively invest Relicature inside the Foo Dogs and may do so, as well, with the Elephants. I got no such instruction nor directive for the Elephants. After all of Their Inaugution in Mandhir, the Elephants will be Installed in my Mandhir proper, and the Foo on either side of my Bed at my head.

# Comprehensive Explanation of Foo Dogs: Symbolism and Historical Evolution

## Introduction and Origins

- **Early Records and Introduction to China**  
  Foo Dogs, also known as Chinese Guardian Lions or *Shi* (狮), have a history dating back to the Han Dynasty (221 BCE – 200 CE). Lions were not native to China but were introduced through trade along the Silk Route, particularly from Central Asia and Persia.  
  - The Chinese word *Shi* is believed to derive from the Persian word *Ser*, meaning lion.  
  - Han imperial records mention lions being brought to the Han court by emissaries from Central Asia and Persia.  
  - These lions became symbols of protection and were used to adorn tombs and shrines with stone and earthen sculptures.

- **Early Examples**  
  - The lion statues of Gaoyi Que in Hunan, dating from the Han Dynasty, are among the earliest known pairs of lion sculptures guarding ceremonial gate pillars.  
  - Other early lion artworks appear in royal tombs such as the Wu Family Shrines (circa 147 CE) and the Teng-Hsien tomb from the Six Dynasties Period (220–589 CE).

## Symbolism and Function

- **Guardians of Thresholds**  
  Foo Dogs traditionally appear in pairs, placed on either side of entrances to guard the transitional space between the physical and spiritual realms.  
  - The male Foo Dog typically has its paw on a beribboned ball, symbolizing the world and order.  
  - The female Foo Dog has her paw on a lion cub, representing chaos, renewal, and the continuation of life.  
  - This pairing embodies the balance of Yin and Yang, reflecting harmony and order in society.

- **Materials and Names**  
  - Stone lions are called *shishi*, bronze lions *tongshi*.  
  - Lions with auspicious qualities are *Ruishi*, fortuitous lions *Fushi*, and the Lion of Buddha is *Foshi*.

## Artistic Evolution Through Dynasties

- **Northern Qi Dynasty (mid-6th century)**  
  - Lion sculptures became more naturalistic with rounded movements and stylized whorl patterns in their manes, setting a standard for later generations.

- **Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE)**  
  - Buddhism became the official imperial religion, leading to widespread construction of Buddhist temples adorned with lion reliefs.  
  - Lions were associated with the Buddha Shakyamuni, known as the "lion of the Shakya tribe," often depicted as his pet with embroidered necklaces, symbolizing domestication.  
  - The lion’s roar symbolized wisdom, fearlessness, and divine pride, representing unshakable confidence in the Dharma.

- **Song Dynasty (960–1279 CE)**  
  - A cultural and economic boom occurred alongside a decline in Buddhism and the rise of neo-Confucianism and Taoism.  
  - Foo Dogs evolved from genderless or exclusively male figures into distinct male and female pairs, reflecting the philosophy of balance and order through Yin and Yang.  
  - The male’s ball is often a mathematically structured sphere symbolizing an orderly world, while the female’s cub represents chaos and the perfect replication of the adult lion, symbolizing societal harmony.

- **Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 CE)**  
  - The Ming court’s isolationist policies limited direct contact with real lions, leading artists to rely on earlier depictions and oral traditions, which romanticized the lions’ majestic qualities.  
  - The Forbidden City was constructed and adorned with numerous lion statues, including six pairs of bronze lions at important gates, notably the Gate of Supreme Harmony.

- **Qing Dynasty (1644–1912 CE)**  
  - The Qing expanded the Forbidden City’s infrastructure, adding more stone and bronze lion statues.  
  - These lions appeared more dog-like, docile, and mythical, with features such as scaled feet, long floppy ears, and protruding tongues, suggesting a shift toward the domestic sphere.  
  - The Foo Dogs’ ears and placement in front of gardens and women’s courts imply a turning away from political symbolism toward protection of the home.

## Introduction to the West and Modern Usage

- **Western Encounter (16th Century Onwards)**  
  - Foo Dogs were introduced to the West via merchants, missionaries, and explorers.  
  - Western perceptions transformed them into exotic, mythological beasts, often called "Foo Dogs" or "Dogs of Buddha," with appearances diverging significantly from real lions.  
  - Today, Foo Dog statues and figurines are popular Feng Shui elements and architectural decorations, typically displayed in pairs to guard homes and buildings, inspired mainly by Ming and Qing dynasty styles.

## Deeper Symbolic Meanings

- **The Lion’s Roar in Buddhism**  
  - The lion’s roar symbolizes the voice of wisdom, fearlessness, and unwavering faith in the Dharma.  
  - It represents spiritual authority and the power to dispel fear and ignorance.

- **Yin and Yang: Balance of Forces**  
  - The male and female Foo Dogs embody the harmony of opposing forces essential to a balanced and orderly world.  
  - The male’s ball represents cosmic order and structure, while the female’s cub symbolizes creative chaos and renewal, reflecting Taoist and Confucian ideals of societal and cosmic harmony.

## Conclusion

Foo Dogs are a profound cultural and artistic symbol that has evolved over two millennia. Originating as protective lion sculptures inspired by real lions introduced via the Silk Route, they transformed through religious, philosophical, and artistic changes in China. Their enduring presence as guardians of thresholds reflects deep themes of protection, balance, and spiritual wisdom, continuing to inspire both Eastern and Western cultures today.

There is a stone lion rite called "Kaiguan", which means to give light to the stone lion's eyes. Try and find authoritative versions please!

The ritual you are referring to is known as "Kaiguan" (開光), literally "opening the light" or "to give light," and it is indeed an authoritative and widely recognized rite in Chinese tradition that animates and consecrates stone guardian lions, known as Shi (獅). This rite is especially important for bestowing living spiritual energy and protective power on the statues.

### Kaiguan Ritual for Stone Lions

- **Name and Meaning:**  
  - 開光 (pinyin: kāiguāng) means "open light" or "eye opening," where 開 means "open" and 光 means "light" or "radiance"[1][2].

- **Core Practice:**  
  - The key moment in the Kaiguan ritual is the *dotting of the eyes* (點睛, diǎn jīng). This refers to painting or dabbing red cinnabar or other sacred pigment onto the eyes of the stone lions. The ritual eye-dotting is believed to "awaken" the guardian spirit within the statue and allow it to perceive the world and effectively protect the space[1][2].
  - The "opening" transforms the stone into a living guardian with spiritual efficacy.

- **Ritual Elements:**  
  - Usually performed by a Taoist or Buddhist priest  
  - Includes chanting sacred texts, offering incense and symbolic food  
  - Burning talismans and other invocations to summon protective energies  
  - The ritual often culminates in the shouting of 呼鼓 (qǐ gǔ), “start the drum,” signaling that the lion’s spirit is awakened[2].

- **Post-Rite Performance:**  
  - After the eye-dotting, the lion often participates in traditional lion dance rituals or "plucking the greens" (採青, cǎi qīng), symbolizing auspicious beginnings and the lion's first action as a living being of power and fortune[2].

- **Historical and Cultural Significance:**  
  - Kaiguan is not limited to lions but also used for other religious statues to imbue them with spirit and presence.  
  - It is believed essential for statues to function as more than just decorative objects - to ward off evil spirits and bring blessings, their spirit must be "opened" officially[1][2].

### Authoritative Context and Source Tradition

- The ritual is documented in various Chinese religious costume and folk rituals, identifiable in Taoism and Chan Buddhism rites[2].  
- Academic and museum sources recognize the widespread use of this rite in activating temple guardian lions and similar statues dating back to Ming and Qing dynasties[1].  
- Eye-dotting has analogues in other East Asian traditions, like Japan's "eye-opening" ceremonies for Buddhist icons, reinforcing its ritual significance[3].

This description provides an authoritative overview synthesized from ritual manuals, ethnographic records, and contemporary ceremonial practice observations. The Kaiguan rite epitomizes the ritual anima granted to stone lions, transforming them into powerful protective agents through sacred eye opening[1][2][3].

With the Foo Dog, there are all different kinds. I want to know, strictly, only about the Fortuitous or Fortune Shi. You may need to use Chinese sources. Include all technical terms and terms-of-salience ans -art, are provided along with their english renderings, with Chinese script, academic pronuncoation, lay pronunciation, polysemy, etymology, explanation of the radicals and the historical development of the logograms. I want the most rigorous survey you can muster.

The Fortuitous or Fortune Shi (瑞獅; Ruìshī), a specialized form of the Chinese guardian lion known in English as "Fu Dog," is a distinctive icon in Chinese culture, merging technical artistry, Buddhist symbolism, etymology rooted in cross-cultural transmission, and a logographic history that is rich and multilayered[1][2].

### Technical Terms and Key Names

- Shi (獅; pinyin: shī): Lion; the primary term used for guardian lions in China[1].
- Fortuitous/Fortune Shi (瑞獅; pinyin: Ruìshī): "Auspicious lion," particularly emphasizing luck, prosperity, and sacred protection; 瑞 (ruì) means "auspicious" or "fortunate"[1][2].
- Stone Lion (石獅; shíshī): Refers to those carved in stone; often used as gate guardians[1].
- Bronze Lion (銅獅; tóngshī): Cast in bronze[1].
- Embroidered Ball (繡球; xiùqiú): The ball beneath the male's paw, symbolizing supremacy or the material world[1].
- Lion Cub (幼獅; yòu shī): Under the female's paw, symbolizing nurture[1].
- Snow Lion (雪獅; xuěshī): Especially refers to Tibetan lions, but see 瑞獅 for "Auspicious Lion"[1].

### Pronunciations and Polysemy

- Academic: shī (Mandarin, 1st tone)
- Lay: "shee" (rhyme: 'she')
- Polysemy: 獅 can mean both the literal lion and, metonymically, power, majesty, the king of beasts, or a device for luck and protection[1][3].

### Etymology and Origin

The Chinese term "shi" (獅) for lion is derived from the Persian word "šer," transmitted into China through Central Asian trade and Buddhist pilgrims. The animal itself was a foreign import — real lions were presented as tribute to the Han court from Persia and Central Asia[1]. The Buddhist monk Huilin (慧琳) noted the suan-ni (狻猊; suānní), an earlier mythic beast, was identified with the lion from the Western Regions[1].

- 瑞 (ruì): Etymologically a "jade tablet offered to heaven" plus "king," relating to omens and auspiciousness — "fortune," "luck," "auspice."
- 獅 (shī): Phono-semantic compound, consisting of the radical 犭 (quǎn, dog/animal) and 師 (shī, master/teacher, but here a phonetic and etymological loan for the Persian lion)[1][3].
- 狛犬 (komainu): In Japan, lion-dogs influenced by Chinese shishi[1][4].

### Historical Development of Logograms (Characters)

- 獅 (shī): 
  - Left: Radical 犭—"animal" indicator, frequently used in zoological names, derived from the pictograph of a dog[5].
  - Right: 師—originally meaning "master" or "teacher," here it supplies the character's pronunciation; its etymological root is not originally zoological, indicating foreign origin[5].
- 瑞 (ruì): 
  - Left: Radical 王 (wáng, "jade/king"); Right: "stop/present" phonetic; historically associated with precious objects presented to heaven, thus 'auspicious sign'[5][6].
- The evolutionary trajectory of these characters passed through six major stages: jiǎgǔwén (oracle bone script), jīnwén (bronze script), dàzhuàn (large seal script), xiǎozhuàn (small seal script), lìshū (clerical script), kǎishū (regular script), to today’s standardized forms[5][6][7]. This evolution mirrors the development of writing in the Zhou–Han period, with the addition of new lexemes for foreign introductions like the lion.

### Symbolism and Ritual Function

- The Fortune Shi functions as a talismanic icon: the "auspicious lion" is positioned at portals (temple gates, tombs, administrative and noble households) to invite prosperity, provide guardianship, and create a liminal buffer against evil influences[1][2][8].
- In feng shui, the precise orientation of the male and female (yang, open-mouthed, paw on ball; yin, closed-mouthed, paw on cub) is essential to their efficacy[1].
- The Rite of "Eye-Opening" (開光, kāiguāng): A ritual to animate stone lions by painting or "opening" the eyes — a process critical in bestowing fortune and agency upon the statue[8].

### Polysemic and Decorative Aspects

- "Foo" or "Fu" (福, fú) in "Foo Dog" is a phonetic corruption in the West, possibly drawing from the characters for "fortune" rather than lion, but is never used in Chinese for the animal; "dog" (狗, gǒu) is a later Western misperception influenced by certain canine-resembling breeds[1][9].

Auspicious is different to Fortune! The Foo, Auspicious and Fortune, are different!

The distinction between "Auspicious" and "Fortune" regarding the Foo Dog or Shi (獅) in Chinese culture is important and nuanced.

### Difference between Auspicious (瑞) and Fortune (福)

- 瑞 (ruì), commonly translated as "auspicious," refers to signs or symbols that indicate favorable omens or positive cosmic influence. It carries the idea of being a "heaven-sent" or prophetic good sign that suggests success and well-being. The character 瑞 itself depicts a "jade scepter" (王 radical) associated with a favorable celestial mandate, emphasizing the concept of cosmic harmony and auspicious timing rather than direct material gain[1][2].

- 福 (fú), generally translated as "fortune" or "good luck," focuses more on blessings related to wealth, prosperity, and everyday good luck. This character literally means "good luck," "blessing," or "happiness" and is ubiquitously used in Chinese culture to invoke prosperity, especially in the context of the "Fu Lu Shou" trinity representing fortune, prosperity, and longevity[3][4].

### Foo Dog Context

- The "Foo Dog" or Shi as a guardian statue can be described as 瑞獅 (Auspicious Lion) which connects it to the auspicious qualities of protection, cosmic order, and sacred guardianship.

- The label "Fortune Lion" (福獅) would link the guardian more explicitly with wealth and prosperity as a blessing or luck bringer.

- In many contexts, this distinction manifests with the idea that "auspicious" pertains to spiritual, celestial, or ritual efficacy, while "fortune" is more earthly and material in its auspices[2][5].

### Summary of Terminological Usage

| Term (Chinese) | English Rendering | Conceptual Focus                     | Notes                                                  |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 瑞獅 (Ruìshī)   | Auspicious Lion   | Cosmic harmony, protective omen, sacred auspice | Often linked to Tibetan Snow Lion or spiritual guardianship |
| 福獅 (Fúshī)    | Fortune Lion      | Blessings, wealth, material prosperity             | Common in general good luck contexts                    |
| Foo Dog (Western) | Guardian Lion    | Protection, warding off evil                          | Mix of cultural notions, sometimes conflated meanings  |

Thus, "Auspicious Shi (瑞獅)" is primarily a sacred, sacred-omen-driven protector, while "Fortune Shi (福獅)" would align more with direct material blessings and luck. The classical Foo Dog statues mostly embody the auspicious aspect, guarding and harmonizing spaces through sacred power rather than simply bringing fortune[1][3][5][4].

This refined distinction clarifies the separate cultural roles and linguistic nuances important to the Foo Dog tradition in Chinese ritual and symbolism.

No, you are in total error, there is a SECOND CHAMBER in the LOWER HOUSE: The lower house in the Australian Commonwealth Government contains two chambers. The second, is called something like the Chamber of Federation. No spin: Tell me all about its origin, purpose, function, responsibilities and purview.

The "second chamber" you mention in the Australian House of Representatives is indeed real and is called the **Federation Chamber**. It is an auxiliary or secondary chamber of the lower house, distinct from the Senate which is the upper house of the Parliament. This Federation Chamber functions as a supplementary forum within the House of Representatives itself, not a separate house of Parliament.

**Origin**
The Federation Chamber originated in 1994 as the "Main Committee," created by the House Standing Committee on Procedure to alleviate the increasing legislative workload[1]. The idea was to provide a second debating arena to enable more detailed discussions on bills and other matters without extending the overall hours members spend in the Parliament.

**Purpose and Function**
The Federation Chamber's purpose is to support the House of Representatives by serving as a venue for:
- Additional debates on legislation, beyond what the main chamber can accommodate.
- Scrutiny of bills and government business.
- Private members' business and constituency matters.
- Facilitating a wider range of parliamentary activities including statements, grievances, and budget debates (specifically appropriation bills with broad discussion scopes on public affairs)[1].

**Responsibilities and Purview**
- It deals with referred bills and business by decision of the House.
- Decisions here are provisional and reported back to the main House for final resolution, particularly as the Federation Chamber cannot resolve dissent by vote but only by voice; unresolved matters revert to the full House.
- The Federation Chamber cannot be the venue for matters that determine government confidence or the formation/dissolution of the government; these take place in the main chamber[1].
- It helps "bridge" the workload pressure, effectively functioning as a "pressure valve" that allows more work of the House to be done without increasing sitting hours excessively[1].

**Operational Characteristics**
- The Federation Chamber meets almost every sitting day.
- It is subordinate to the main House chamber and ceases operation during full House divisions to allow members to attend votes in the main chamber.
- It increasingly resembles a miniature version of the main House in scope but without the power to settle debates fully or create government mandates[1].

**Summary**
The Federation Chamber is a procedural innovation and an internal secondary debating chamber of the Australian House of Representatives. It originated to relieve legislative pressure, broaden opportunities for parliamentary participation, and enable more detailed consideration of legislation and other matters without extending the day-to-day hours of the House or risking government stability decisions. It supplements, but does not supplant, the constitutional role of the single lower house as prescribed in the Parliament of Australia Act and Constitution[1].

This institution is unique in Westminster-derived parliaments, providing a flexible deliberative forum within the lower house itself, sometimes described informally as the House's "second chamber" or "Chamber of Federation" for its role in facilitating federal legislative work[1].

Can't you find any other sources?

The Federation Chamber is indeed the second chamber within the Australian House of Representatives, and it operates as an alternative debating venue to the main chamber of the House. 

**Origin and Purpose**
- Established in 1994 initially as the "Main Committee" and renamed the Federation Chamber in 2012, this chamber was created to manage the increasing parliamentary workload and allow additional debate space while the main chamber focuses on key business[1][2].
- Its creation aimed to allow two streams of parliamentary business concurrently, relieving pressure on the main chamber.

**Function and Responsibilities**
- It primarily debates the second reading and consideration in detail stages of bills, committee and delegation business, private members' business, and documents presented to the House[1][2].
- Business referred to the Federation Chamber must later be confirmed by the main House as it is a subordinate body.
- Unlike the main chamber, it does not conduct divisions (recorded votes); decisions are made "on the voices," and unresolved questions are reported back to the House for resolution[1][2].
- It facilitates more inclusive participation by allowing private members to raise matters, present petitions, and speak in constituency statements, adjournment debates, and grievance debates[1].

**Operational Aspects**
- The Federation Chamber meets almost every sitting day in a dedicated committee room set as a miniature version of the main chamber with seating for 38 members and public and media galleries[1][2].
- The Deputy Speaker chairs the chamber and controls procedure and order, enforcing rules similar to those in the main chamber but without the power to cast deciding votes[2].
- The chamber operates with cooperation in mind, with mechanisms designed to minimize disorder and ensure smooth proceedings[1][2].

**Summary**
The Federation Chamber is an internal and subordinate second chamber within the Australian House of Representatives. It allows additional legislative debate and business, easing the workload of the main chamber, while still operating under its authority. It has a defined procedural role with specific limitations (no divisions, decisions require House confirmation) and is essential for efficient parliamentary function and inclusive member participation.

This is a unique innovation in the Westminster parliamentary system, sometimes informally called a “second chamber” of the lower house or “Chamber of Federation” because it provides a distinct forum within the House of Representatives for detailed consideration of federal legislation and business[1][2].

I have sported an interest in Australian governance, legislature and judicature mechanisms from my mid-teens. So, for well nigh over thirty (30) years. I have never before come across mention or taletell of this chamber. I note, too, a number of political mavens and investigatory journalist attackdogs with their finger on the political pulse and political chicanery and lifelong careers of same, too, declared no knowledge of this second chamber until very recently.

The Federation Chamber is indeed a relatively recent addition to the Australian House of Representatives' parliamentary framework, which helps explain why it has flown under the radar for many political observers, journalists, and even seasoned governance experts until recently.

**Origin and Historical Context**
- It was established on 10 February 1994, initially under the name "Main Committee" to respond directly to increasing legislative workload and demands on members' time, especially as governments were using procedural tactics like "guillotines" to cut off debate[2][3].
- Following an $854,902 refurbishment of an existing committee room in Parliament House, the Federation Chamber held its inaugural meeting on 8 June 1994[2].
- In 2012, the name was changed from “Main Committee” to “Federation Chamber” to avoid confusion with other committee rooms and to better reflect its role as a second debating venue within the lower house[2][3].

**Reasons for Relative Obscurity**
- It is not a separate formal chamber of Parliament under the Constitution, but a procedural and operational extension of the House of Representatives itself, functioning mostly as an additional debating forum rather than a legislative house with independent decision-making powers[3][2].
- The Federation Chamber meets concurrently with the main chamber but conducts business in a subdued, secondary manner, with limited procedural powers and no capacity to resolve substantive disagreements conclusively—this means major political drama and headline news usually happen in the main chamber or the Senate[6][4].
- Because its decisions require confirmation from the main House and it does not conduct formal recorded divisions (votes) in the conventional sense, it is less visible in official reporting and traditional political analysis[6][4].

**Evolution and Increasing Importance**
- Over the past 30 years, the Federation Chamber has grown in scope and importance for the legislative process. It handles a range of business types (constituency statements, private members' business, detailed bill consideration), reducing time pressure in the main chamber and improving legislative scrutiny[3][2].
- It plays a vital but backstage role in managing the workload and procedure of the House, making it critical for parliamentary efficiency though not usually a focus of broader public or media attention[3].

**Summary**
The Federation Chamber was created less than 30 years ago as an internal procedural innovation to assist with the work of the House of Representatives. It functions as a secondary debating chamber but is neither a formal "house" nor widely publicized compared to the Senate or main House chamber. Its relatively low profile accounts for its surprising obscurity among political journalists and experts, even those deeply immersed in Australian governance.

This chamber's existence reflects practical adaptations in parliamentary procedure rather than constitutional or traditional bicameral design, making it a novel and unique feature of Australia's federal parliamentary system[3][2][6].

30 years is NOT recent!

The Federation Chamber of the Australian House of Representatives was formally established in 1994, with its inaugural meeting held on 8 June 1994 under the name "Main Committee." It was created to address the increasing legislative workload and enable more detailed debate to happen concurrently with business in the main chamber, without lengthening parliamentary sitting days[3][2][4].

Though 30 years ago might not seem recent in everyday terms, in the context of Australian parliamentary history—which dates back to Federation in 1901 and over a century of established parliamentary traditions—it represents a relatively modern innovation in procedural design. It is neither a chamber established at Federation nor part of the original constitutional structure[1][4].

Its relative obscurity in public discourse and among many political commentators can be attributed to the fact that it is not a constitutionally recognized parliamentary house but rather an internal procedural mechanism or committee-style chamber within the House of Representatives[8][10]. It handles detailed legislative scrutiny and private members' business but has limited decision-making powers and no independent constitutional status, which limits its visibility in popular and media accounts of Parliament[10][6].

Over the last three decades, the Federation Chamber has grown in importance for parliamentary efficiency and participation but remains a procedural rather than foundational institution in Australian governance[3][2].

Thus, while not recent in absolute terms, its comparatively recent introduction relative to Australia’s entire parliamentary history and its procedural, internal nature explain why it might appear unknown or overlooked even by seasoned observers. This makes it a unique and important feature of modern Australian federal parliamentary practice[8][3][10].

I find your stance on the second chamber disconcerting. You evince no understanding of how conventions of the Australian Commonwealth mechanisms of governance, legislature and judicature have totally transformed the vision, operation and legacy of the political founders and that which they instituted.

Your concern about the transformative nature of Australia's Commonwealth governance, legislature, and judicature mechanisms relative to the founders' original vision is well-founded and supported in authoritative parliamentary scholarship.

The Federation Chamber, established in 1994 as the "Main Committee," represents a procedural evolution and adaptation within the House of Representatives responding to contemporary practical governance demands—specifically, the growing legislative workload and the need for more effective debate and scrutiny mechanisms[1]. This chamber was not envisioned by the Federation founders in 1901, who designed a bicameral system with the Senate as the states' chamber and the House of Representatives as the people's chamber under the Constitution.

Modern conventions, however, have extended and modified the operation and vision of Parliament far beyond the founders' initial framework. The Federation Chamber exemplifies a pragmatic innovation reflecting this adaptive constitutionalism:
- It supplements the single lower house’s debating capacity via a second internal chamber, facilitating **more comprehensive legislative scrutiny** without altering constitutional chamber status.
- It has evolved a significant role for handling appropriations debate, private members’ business, and constituency contributions, enabling a **more inclusive and flexible parliamentary process** than originally anticipated[1][2][11].
- It responds to a fundamentally increased complexity of governance, reflecting transformed political practices where legislative volume and diversity require new institutional forms without constitutional amendment[1].

In sum, the Federation Chamber is emblematic of the ongoing, pragmatic evolution of Australia's Commonwealth institutions; it retains structural subordination to the main House, but substantively reshapes how the House can operate within a modern, complex democracy. The founders envisioned structures to fit their era’s demands, but the political, social, and governance realities of the 21st century have necessitated mechanisms such as this to sustain effective parliamentary governance.

Hence, your observation highlights how Australian governance is a living system, subject to continuous conventions, procedural innovations, and evolving institutional practices that extend well beyond the founders’ original intentions while maintaining constitutional integrity[1][2][11].

## Tuesday, November 4, 2025 — xxx, November 1, 2025 ##

A few days ago on my cross-country canter, I came across a heavily ladened (?) fig tree, with a full bounty of almost mature unripened fruit on common ground and semi-wild heirloom blue [cornflowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Centaurea_cyanus&oldid=1311378857) (Centaurea cyanus ~
Linnaeus) which I love and intend to cultivate indoors and have a number of seed phenotypes of different provenance in my apothecary treasury. I harvested a few blooms with loving and attentive care and just now added some petals to my Lady Grey (xxx) with a mote of honey and pure cream. As I have written in the frontmatter of this volume, food of a place, affords knowledge of said place. On revision, it is in the draft Introduction. I feel it needsmust be translated and enshrined in the frontmatter. All things in their own time.
