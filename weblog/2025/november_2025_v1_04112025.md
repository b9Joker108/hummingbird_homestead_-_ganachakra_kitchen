A few days ago on my cross-country canter, I came across a heavily ladened (?) fig tree, with a full bounty of almost mature unripened fruit on common ground and semi-wild heirloom blue cornflowers which I love and intend to cultivate indoors and have a number of seed phenotypes of different provenance. I harvested a few blooms with loving and attentive care and just now added some petals to my Lady Grey (xxx) with a mote of honey and pure cream.
