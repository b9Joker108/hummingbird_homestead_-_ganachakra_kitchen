### Tuesday, November 11, 2025 ###

I am finally inaugurating and installing my new jade-green glazed ceramic Foo Dogs and recovered old pair of glazed Indian ceramic Temple Elephants. Whilst I was drying the Female Foo Mother and Child, post Their holybath, I had the clear instruction for their placement beside my bed, which surprised me greatly. I will progressively invest relicature inside the Foo Dogs and may do so, as well, with the Elephants.

# Comprehensive Explanation of Foo Dogs: Symbolism and Historical Evolution

## Introduction and Origins

- **Early Records and Introduction to China**  
  Foo Dogs, also known as Chinese Guardian Lions or *Shi* (狮), have a history dating back to the Han Dynasty (221 BCE – 200 CE). Lions were not native to China but were introduced through trade along the Silk Route, particularly from Central Asia and Persia.  
  - The Chinese word *Shi* is believed to derive from the Persian word *Ser*, meaning lion.  
  - Han imperial records mention lions being brought to the Han court by emissaries from Central Asia and Persia.  
  - These lions became symbols of protection and were used to adorn tombs and shrines with stone and earthen sculptures.

- **Early Examples**  
  - The lion statues of Gaoyi Que in Hunan, dating from the Han Dynasty, are among the earliest known pairs of lion sculptures guarding ceremonial gate pillars.  
  - Other early lion artworks appear in royal tombs such as the Wu Family Shrines (circa 147 CE) and the Teng-Hsien tomb from the Six Dynasties Period (220–589 CE).

## Symbolism and Function

- **Guardians of Thresholds**  
  Foo Dogs traditionally appear in pairs, placed on either side of entrances to guard the transitional space between the physical and spiritual realms.  
  - The male Foo Dog typically has its paw on a beribboned ball, symbolizing the world and order.  
  - The female Foo Dog has her paw on a lion cub, representing chaos, renewal, and the continuation of life.  
  - This pairing embodies the balance of Yin and Yang, reflecting harmony and order in society.

- **Materials and Names**  
  - Stone lions are called *shishi*, bronze lions *tongshi*.  
  - Lions with auspicious qualities are *Ruishi*, fortuitous lions *Fushi*, and the Lion of Buddha is *Foshi*.

## Artistic Evolution Through Dynasties

- **Northern Qi Dynasty (mid-6th century)**  
  - Lion sculptures became more naturalistic with rounded movements and stylized whorl patterns in their manes, setting a standard for later generations.

- **Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE)**  
  - Buddhism became the official imperial religion, leading to widespread construction of Buddhist temples adorned with lion reliefs.  
  - Lions were associated with the Buddha Shakyamuni, known as the "lion of the Shakya tribe," often depicted as his pet with embroidered necklaces, symbolizing domestication.  
  - The lion’s roar symbolized wisdom, fearlessness, and divine pride, representing unshakable confidence in the Dharma.

- **Song Dynasty (960–1279 CE)**  
  - A cultural and economic boom occurred alongside a decline in Buddhism and the rise of neo-Confucianism and Taoism.  
  - Foo Dogs evolved from genderless or exclusively male figures into distinct male and female pairs, reflecting the philosophy of balance and order through Yin and Yang.  
  - The male’s ball is often a mathematically structured sphere symbolizing an orderly world, while the female’s cub represents chaos and the perfect replication of the adult lion, symbolizing societal harmony.

- **Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 CE)**  
  - The Ming court’s isolationist policies limited direct contact with real lions, leading artists to rely on earlier depictions and oral traditions, which romanticized the lions’ majestic qualities.  
  - The Forbidden City was constructed and adorned with numerous lion statues, including six pairs of bronze lions at important gates, notably the Gate of Supreme Harmony.

- **Qing Dynasty (1644–1912 CE)**  
  - The Qing expanded the Forbidden City’s infrastructure, adding more stone and bronze lion statues.  
  - These lions appeared more dog-like, docile, and mythical, with features such as scaled feet, long floppy ears, and protruding tongues, suggesting a shift toward the domestic sphere.  
  - The Foo Dogs’ ears and placement in front of gardens and women’s courts imply a turning away from political symbolism toward protection of the home.

## Introduction to the West and Modern Usage

- **Western Encounter (16th Century Onwards)**  
  - Foo Dogs were introduced to the West via merchants, missionaries, and explorers.  
  - Western perceptions transformed them into exotic, mythological beasts, often called "Foo Dogs" or "Dogs of Buddha," with appearances diverging significantly from real lions.  
  - Today, Foo Dog statues and figurines are popular Feng Shui elements and architectural decorations, typically displayed in pairs to guard homes and buildings, inspired mainly by Ming and Qing dynasty styles.

## Deeper Symbolic Meanings

- **The Lion’s Roar in Buddhism**  
  - The lion’s roar symbolizes the voice of wisdom, fearlessness, and unwavering faith in the Dharma.  
  - It represents spiritual authority and the power to dispel fear and ignorance.

- **Yin and Yang: Balance of Forces**  
  - The male and female Foo Dogs embody the harmony of opposing forces essential to a balanced and orderly world.  
  - The male’s ball represents cosmic order and structure, while the female’s cub symbolizes creative chaos and renewal, reflecting Taoist and Confucian ideals of societal and cosmic harmony.

## Summary Timeline

| Period / Dynasty | Key Developments |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **Han (221 BCE – 200 CE)** | Introduction of lions; early guardian sculptures; Persian influence. |
| **Six Dynasties (220–589 CE)** | Lion imagery in royal tombs; consolidation of protective symbolism. |
| **Northern Qi (6th century)** | More naturalistic lion sculptures; stylized mane patterns. |
| **Tang (618–907 CE)** | Buddhism official; lions as Buddha’s pets; symbolic roar. |
| **Song (960–1279 CE)** | Male/female pairs; Yin-Yang balance; mathematical symbolism. |
| **Ming (1368–1644 CE)** | Isolation; mythologized lions; Forbidden City lion statues. |
| **Qing (1644–1912 CE)** | More dog-like, domestic lions; expanded Forbidden City statues. |
| **16th Century Onward** | Introduction to West; popular Feng Shui and decorative use. |

## Conclusion

Foo Dogs are a profound cultural and artistic symbol that has evolved over two millennia. Originating as protective lion sculptures inspired by real lions introduced via the Silk Route, they transformed through religious, philosophical, and artistic changes in China. Their enduring presence as guardians of thresholds reflects deep themes of protection, balance, and spiritual wisdom, continuing to inspire both Eastern and Western cultures today.

No, you are in total error, there is a SECOND CHAMBER in the LOWER HOUSE: The lower house in the Australian Commonwealth Government contains two chambers. The second, is called something like the Chamber of Federation. No spin: Tell me all about its origin, purpose, function, responsibilities and purview.

The "second chamber" you mention in the Australian House of Representatives is indeed real and is called the **Federation Chamber**. It is an auxiliary or secondary chamber of the lower house, distinct from the Senate which is the upper house of the Parliament. This Federation Chamber functions as a supplementary forum within the House of Representatives itself, not a separate house of Parliament.

**Origin**
The Federation Chamber originated in 1994 as the "Main Committee," created by the House Standing Committee on Procedure to alleviate the increasing legislative workload[1]. The idea was to provide a second debating arena to enable more detailed discussions on bills and other matters without extending the overall hours members spend in the Parliament.

**Purpose and Function**
The Federation Chamber's purpose is to support the House of Representatives by serving as a venue for:
- Additional debates on legislation, beyond what the main chamber can accommodate.
- Scrutiny of bills and government business.
- Private members' business and constituency matters.
- Facilitating a wider range of parliamentary activities including statements, grievances, and budget debates (specifically appropriation bills with broad discussion scopes on public affairs)[1].

**Responsibilities and Purview**
- It deals with referred bills and business by decision of the House.
- Decisions here are provisional and reported back to the main House for final resolution, particularly as the Federation Chamber cannot resolve dissent by vote but only by voice; unresolved matters revert to the full House.
- The Federation Chamber cannot be the venue for matters that determine government confidence or the formation/dissolution of the government; these take place in the main chamber[1].
- It helps "bridge" the workload pressure, effectively functioning as a "pressure valve" that allows more work of the House to be done without increasing sitting hours excessively[1].

**Operational Characteristics**
- The Federation Chamber meets almost every sitting day.
- It is subordinate to the main House chamber and ceases operation during full House divisions to allow members to attend votes in the main chamber.
- It increasingly resembles a miniature version of the main House in scope but without the power to settle debates fully or create government mandates[1].

**Summary**
The Federation Chamber is a procedural innovation and an internal secondary debating chamber of the Australian House of Representatives. It originated to relieve legislative pressure, broaden opportunities for parliamentary participation, and enable more detailed consideration of legislation and other matters without extending the day-to-day hours of the House or risking government stability decisions. It supplements, but does not supplant, the constitutional role of the single lower house as prescribed in the Parliament of Australia Act and Constitution[1].

This institution is unique in Westminster-derived parliaments, providing a flexible deliberative forum within the lower house itself, sometimes described informally as the House's "second chamber" or "Chamber of Federation" for its role in facilitating federal legislative work[1].

The Federation Chamber is indeed the second chamber within the Australian House of Representatives, and it operates as an alternative debating venue to the main chamber of the House. 

**Origin and Purpose**
- Established in 1994 initially as the "Main Committee" and renamed the Federation Chamber in 2012, this chamber was created to manage the increasing parliamentary workload and allow additional debate space while the main chamber focuses on key business[1][2].
- Its creation aimed to allow two streams of parliamentary business concurrently, relieving pressure on the main chamber.

**Function and Responsibilities**
- It primarily debates the second reading and consideration in detail stages of bills, committee and delegation business, private members' business, and documents presented to the House[1][2].
- Business referred to the Federation Chamber must later be confirmed by the main House as it is a subordinate body.
- Unlike the main chamber, it does not conduct divisions (recorded votes); decisions are made "on the voices," and unresolved questions are reported back to the House for resolution[1][2].
- It facilitates more inclusive participation by allowing private members to raise matters, present petitions, and speak in constituency statements, adjournment debates, and grievance debates[1].

**Operational Aspects**
- The Federation Chamber meets almost every sitting day in a dedicated committee room set as a miniature version of the main chamber with seating for 38 members and public and media galleries[1][2].
- The Deputy Speaker chairs the chamber and controls procedure and order, enforcing rules similar to those in the main chamber but without the power to cast deciding votes[2].
- The chamber operates with cooperation in mind, with mechanisms designed to minimize disorder and ensure smooth proceedings[1][2].

**Summary**
The Federation Chamber is an internal and subordinate second chamber within the Australian House of Representatives. It allows additional legislative debate and business, easing the workload of the main chamber, while still operating under its authority. It has a defined procedural role with specific limitations (no divisions, decisions require House confirmation) and is essential for efficient parliamentary function and inclusive member participation.

This is a unique innovation in the Westminster parliamentary system, sometimes informally called a “second chamber” of the lower house or “Chamber of Federation” because it provides a distinct forum within the House of Representatives for detailed consideration of federal legislation and business[1][2].

I have sported an interest in Australian governance, legislature and judicature mechanisms from my mid-teens. So, for well nigh over thirty (30) years. I have never before come across mention or taletell of this chamber. I note, too, a number of political mavens and investigatory journalist attackdogs with their finger on the political pulse and political chicanery and lifelong careers of same, too, declared no knowledge of this second chamber until very recently.

The Federation Chamber is indeed a relatively recent addition to the Australian House of Representatives' parliamentary framework, which helps explain why it has flown under the radar for many political observers, journalists, and even seasoned governance experts until recently.

**Origin and Historical Context**
- It was established on 10 February 1994, initially under the name "Main Committee" to respond directly to increasing legislative workload and demands on members' time, especially as governments were using procedural tactics like "guillotines" to cut off debate[2][3].
- Following an $854,902 refurbishment of an existing committee room in Parliament House, the Federation Chamber held its inaugural meeting on 8 June 1994[2].
- In 2012, the name was changed from “Main Committee” to “Federation Chamber” to avoid confusion with other committee rooms and to better reflect its role as a second debating venue within the lower house[2][3].

**Reasons for Relative Obscurity**
- It is not a separate formal chamber of Parliament under the Constitution, but a procedural and operational extension of the House of Representatives itself, functioning mostly as an additional debating forum rather than a legislative house with independent decision-making powers[3][2].
- The Federation Chamber meets concurrently with the main chamber but conducts business in a subdued, secondary manner, with limited procedural powers and no capacity to resolve substantive disagreements conclusively—this means major political drama and headline news usually happen in the main chamber or the Senate[6][4].
- Because its decisions require confirmation from the main House and it does not conduct formal recorded divisions (votes) in the conventional sense, it is less visible in official reporting and traditional political analysis[6][4].

**Evolution and Increasing Importance**
- Over the past 30 years, the Federation Chamber has grown in scope and importance for the legislative process. It handles a range of business types (constituency statements, private members' business, detailed bill consideration), reducing time pressure in the main chamber and improving legislative scrutiny[3][2].
- It plays a vital but backstage role in managing the workload and procedure of the House, making it critical for parliamentary efficiency though not usually a focus of broader public or media attention[3].

**Summary**
The Federation Chamber was created less than 30 years ago as an internal procedural innovation to assist with the work of the House of Representatives. It functions as a secondary debating chamber but is neither a formal "house" nor widely publicized compared to the Senate or main House chamber. Its relatively low profile accounts for its surprising obscurity among political journalists and experts, even those deeply immersed in Australian governance.

This chamber's existence reflects practical adaptations in parliamentary procedure rather than constitutional or traditional bicameral design, making it a novel and unique feature of Australia's federal parliamentary system[3][2][6].

30 years is NOT recent!

The Federation Chamber of the Australian House of Representatives was formally established in 1994, with its inaugural meeting held on 8 June 1994 under the name "Main Committee." It was created to address the increasing legislative workload and enable more detailed debate to happen concurrently with business in the main chamber, without lengthening parliamentary sitting days[3][2][4].

Though 30 years ago might not seem recent in everyday terms, in the context of Australian parliamentary history—which dates back to Federation in 1901 and over a century of established parliamentary traditions—it represents a relatively modern innovation in procedural design. It is neither a chamber established at Federation nor part of the original constitutional structure[1][4].

Its relative obscurity in public discourse and among many political commentators can be attributed to the fact that it is not a constitutionally recognized parliamentary house but rather an internal procedural mechanism or committee-style chamber within the House of Representatives[8][10]. It handles detailed legislative scrutiny and private members' business but has limited decision-making powers and no independent constitutional status, which limits its visibility in popular and media accounts of Parliament[10][6].

Over the last three decades, the Federation Chamber has grown in importance for parliamentary efficiency and participation but remains a procedural rather than foundational institution in Australian governance[3][2].

Thus, while not recent in absolute terms, its comparatively recent introduction relative to Australia’s entire parliamentary history and its procedural, internal nature explain why it might appear unknown or overlooked even by seasoned observers. This makes it a unique and important feature of modern Australian federal parliamentary practice[8][3][10].

I find your stance on the second chamber disconcerting. You evince no understanding of how conventions of the Australian Commonwealth mechanisms of governance, legislature and judicature have totally transformed the vision, operation and legacy of the political founders and that which they instituted.

Your concern about the transformative nature of Australia's Commonwealth governance, legislature, and judicature mechanisms relative to the founders' original vision is well-founded and supported in authoritative parliamentary scholarship.

The Federation Chamber, established in 1994 as the "Main Committee," represents a procedural evolution and adaptation within the House of Representatives responding to contemporary practical governance demands—specifically, the growing legislative workload and the need for more effective debate and scrutiny mechanisms[1]. This chamber was not envisioned by the Federation founders in 1901, who designed a bicameral system with the Senate as the states' chamber and the House of Representatives as the people's chamber under the Constitution.

Modern conventions, however, have extended and modified the operation and vision of Parliament far beyond the founders' initial framework. The Federation Chamber exemplifies a pragmatic innovation reflecting this adaptive constitutionalism:
- It supplements the single lower house’s debating capacity via a second internal chamber, facilitating **more comprehensive legislative scrutiny** without altering constitutional chamber status.
- It has evolved a significant role for handling appropriations debate, private members’ business, and constituency contributions, enabling a **more inclusive and flexible parliamentary process** than originally anticipated[1][2][11].
- It responds to a fundamentally increased complexity of governance, reflecting transformed political practices where legislative volume and diversity require new institutional forms without constitutional amendment[1].

In sum, the Federation Chamber is emblematic of the ongoing, pragmatic evolution of Australia's Commonwealth institutions; it retains structural subordination to the main House, but substantively reshapes how the House can operate within a modern, complex democracy. The founders envisioned structures to fit their era’s demands, but the political, social, and governance realities of the 21st century have necessitated mechanisms such as this to sustain effective parliamentary governance.

Hence, your observation highlights how Australian governance is a living system, subject to continuous conventions, procedural innovations, and evolving institutional practices that extend well beyond the founders’ original intentions while maintaining constitutional integrity[1][2][11].

## Tuesday, November 4, 2025 — xxx, November 1, 2025 ##

A few days ago on my cross-country canter, I came across a heavily ladened (?) fig tree, with a full bounty of almost mature unripened fruit on common ground and semi-wild heirloom blue [cornflowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Centaurea_cyanus&oldid=1311378857) (Centaurea cyanus ~
Linnaeus) which I love and intend to cultivate indoors and have a number of seed phenotypes of different provenance in my apothecary treasury. I harvested a few blooms with loving and attentive care and just now added some petals to my Lady Grey (xxx) with a mote of honey and pure cream. As I have written in the frontmatter of this volume, food of a place, affords knowledge of said place. On revision, it is in the draft Introduction. I feel it needsmust be translated and enshrined in the frontmatter. All things in their own time.
