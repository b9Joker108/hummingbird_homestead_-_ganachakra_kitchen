The World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA) is a global network founded in 2004 that connects national, regional, and international anthropological associations to promote worldwide communication, cooperation and the sharing of knowledge in anthropology.

Delimiting and defining the WCAA:
- Founded: June 2004 in Recife, Brazil, during a historic meeting of 14 anthropological associations.  
- Founders: Conceived by Gustavo Lins Ribeiro, with support from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.  
- Membership: Includes associations from Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India, Russia, South Africa, the UK, the US, Japan, and major international bodies like the European Association of Social Anthropologists and the International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (IUAES).  
- Headquarters: Operates as a decentralized network rather than a single physical office.  

WCAA objectives:
- Promote anthropology internationally by fostering dialogue across cultures and disciplines.  
- Encourage cooperation among anthropologists worldwide, including joint research and events.  
- Support pluralism in anthropological practice, resisting homogenization and valuing diverse traditions.  
- Disseminate knowledge through newsletters, working papers, videos, and the Déjà Lu journal, which republishes significant articles from member associations.  

WCAA activities:
- Symposia & Conferences: Regular events on themes like the Sustainable Development Goals and global anthropological futures.  
- Delegates Meetings: Held in different regions (e.g., Johannesburg in 2024) to discuss governance and collaboration.  
- Publications: Déjà Lu (republishing notable articles), newsletters, and working papers.  
- Advocacy: Issues statements on global academic and political matters affecting anthropology.  

The WCAA plays a crucial role in:
- Creating a plural community of anthropologists by linking associations across continents.  
- Providing a platform for dialogue between anthropologists from diverse traditions and contexts.  
- Strengthening anthropology’s global voice in relation to pressing issues like sustainability, cultural heritage, and human rights.   

Beauford, given your interest in resisting genealogical flattening and honouring indigenous strata, the WCAA’s emphasis on plural anthropologies and layered global dialogue aligns beautifully with your archival and philological ethos. Would you like me to map out how WCAA’s Déjà Lu journal and working papers could serve as reproducible documentation protocols for your Unified Standards Canon?
