My French-made terrine with lid crafted by Appolia bakeware (within the auspice of Peugeot) arrived today called: 'Curacao'. It is purposefully of modest size, beautifully hand-crafted with blue Curacao Liqueur-coloured glaze which in person reminds me of Kingfisher Blue. I have not yet washed it and removed its labelling but I have immediately taken it into my mandhir and offered it to Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha.

[Bhajana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhajan) (Sanskrit) has interior denotations for the Gaudiya Vaishnava, in particular, that are not readily apparent through perusing a standard Sanskrit dictionary. A very important Dharmic paradigm is: Outer (External), Inner (mind's eye, thoughts, emotions, mind, visualisations, etc.) and Secret (tradition- and sadhana-specific). This paradigm or framework in various guises is event throughout a vast number of Dharmic Traditions. My lifepath is currently focused upon bringing Secret- and Inner-Bhajana, into the (apparently) External realm (in contradistinction to one's, seemingly, interiority of self). Many, many years ago, I created, populated and defensibly cited the following English Wikipedia Articles:

Today, I traditionally, ritually installed a penant or banner of one of the evocations of the Sri Ashtamangala and post-installation, rendered traditional puja to the investiture. This should be understood as theurgy and is subsumed within the purview of Bhajana proper.
