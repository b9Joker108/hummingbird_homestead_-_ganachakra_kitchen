My French-made terrine with lid crafted by Appolia bakeware (within the auspice of Peugeot) arrived today called: 'Curacao'. It is purposefully of modest size, beautifully hand-crafted with blue Curacao Liqueur-coloured glaze which in person reminds me of Kingfisher Blue. In particular, the finesse of the handles and the lid and the exceptional colour and styling and stoneware practicality for me sealed the deal. I have not yet washed it and removed its labelling but I have immediately taken it into my mandhir and offered it on dais to Sri Sri Radhe-Ballabha.

**Cura√ßao: what language and script is its original provenance?**

Direct answer: The original vernacular language of Cura√ßao is Papiamentu (also called Papiamento), a Creole that developed on the island in the 17th century. Its earliest written form used the Latin script, though with heavy Iberian spelling conventions (Portuguese and Spanish influence). Over time, Cura√ßao standardized Papiamentu orthography in Latin letters, making it the island‚Äôs indigenous written tradition alongside Dutch.

üåç Linguistic Provenance of Cura√ßao
- Indigenous substrate: Before European colonization, the island was inhabited by Arawak-speaking peoples (Caquet√≠o branch). Their language contributed some vocabulary but did not survive as the dominant tongue.  
- Colonial overlay: The Spanish occupied Cura√ßao (1499‚Äì1634), followed by the Dutch (from 1634). Both left strong lexical and orthographic traces.  
- Creole genesis: Papiamentu emerged as a Portuguese- and Spanish-lexified Creole, enriched with African languages (from enslaved populations), Dutch, French and later English.

üìñ Script and Orthography
- Latin script from the start: Unlike some Creoles that remained oral for centuries, Papiamentu was written down relatively early, using Latin letters modeled on Iberian spelling.  
- Orthographic traditions:  
  - Spanish-influenced spelling (used in Aruba and Bonaire).  
  - Etymological vs. phonemic orthography debates in Cura√ßao, leading to reforms in the 20th century.  
- Modern standard: Cura√ßao today uses a phonemic Latin orthography officially recognized in education, media and government.

üèõ Official Languages Today
- Papiamentu (Creole, Latin script) ‚Äì the heart of local identity and daily life.  
- Dutch (Latin script) ‚Äì used in administration, law and formal education.  
- English (Latin script) ‚Äì widely spoken, especially in tourism.

üß© Putting it together
So, if we ask about Cura√ßao‚Äôs original provenance in language and script:  
- Language: Papiamentu, a Creole born of Iberian, African and indigenous contact.  
- Script: Latin alphabet, first in Iberian-style spelling, later standardized into its own Cura√ßaoan orthography.

[Bhajana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhajan) (Sanskrit) has interior denotations for the Gaudiya Vaishnava, in particular, that are not readily apparent through perusing a standard Sanskrit dictionary. A very important Dharmic paradigm is: Outer (External), Inner (mind's eye, thoughts, emotions, mind, visualisations, etc.) and Secret (tradition- and sadhana-specific). This paradigm or framework in various guises is event throughout a vast number of Dharmic Traditions. My lifepath is currently focused upon bringing Secret- and Inner-Bhajana, into the (apparently) External realm (in contradistinction to one's, seemingly, interiority of self). Many, many years ago, I created, populated and defensibly cited the following English Wikipedia Articles:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ashtamangala&oldid=1308269218 (accessed: Thursday, October 09, 2025)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trance&oldid=1315106511 (accessed: Thursday, October 09, 2025)

Today, I traditionally, ritually installed a penant or banner of one of the evocations of the Sri Ashtamangala and post-installation, rendered traditional puja to the investiture. This should be understood as theurgy and is subsumed within the purview of Bhajana proper.
