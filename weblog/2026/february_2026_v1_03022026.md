**Sand, coconut oil, peppermint oil, sugar and what ... should I mix to make my soles babycheek smoov?**

For baby‑cheek smooth soles, you want:  
1) **a *gentle* scrub**, and  
2) **a rich occlusive moisturiser** afterward.  

Given your ingredients (sand, coconut oil, peppermint oil, sugar), here’s how to make it work *safely* and what else to add.

***

## 1. Don’t use sand on skin

Skip the **sand** entirely: it’s too sharp and irregular, can micro‑tear skin and drive grit into cracks. Use **sugar** as your main exfoliant instead; it dissolves and self‑limits abrasion.

***

## 2. Simple peppermint foot scrub

Use this in the shower or over a basin; 1–2× per week is enough.

**Ingredients**

- 2 tbsp white sugar (finer = gentler)  
- 1 tbsp coconut oil (melted but cool)  
- 2–4 drops peppermint essential oil  
- Optional: 1 tsp fine salt (if your soles are really tough)  

**Method**

- Mix sugar and coconut oil to a wet sand texture: you want it **thick**, not runny.  
- Add peppermint oil and stir well.  
- On damp feet, massage into soles and heels for 1–3 minutes, focusing on rough spots.  
- Rinse off thoroughly and pat dry.

If your heels are cracked or sensitive, drop the salt and keep pressure light.

## 3. What to mix in for real “baby‑cheek” softness

After exfoliation, you need something richer than just coconut oil.

Add **one of these** to your kit:

- **Shea butter**: mix 1–2 parts shea butter with 1 part coconut oil to make a thick balm.  
- **Beeswax + oil**: melt 1 part beeswax with 3–4 parts oil (coconut + another liquid oil like olive or jojoba); when it cools, it becomes a salve.  

**Example night balm**

- 2 tbsp shea butter  
- 1 tbsp coconut oil  
- 2–3 drops peppermint oil  

Gently melt, stir, cool until thick and creamy, then massage a small amount into clean, dry feet at night and put on thin cotton socks.

***

## 4. Routine that actually changes the skin

- 1–2× per week: peppermint sugar scrub in the shower.  
- Every night for 1–2 weeks: apply your balm generously + cotton socks.  
- Once soles are soft, drop to maintenance (balm 2–3× per week).

If you already have deep cracks, keep scrub pressure very light and prioritise balm + socks; the smoothness will come from consistent moisturising, not more abrasion.
