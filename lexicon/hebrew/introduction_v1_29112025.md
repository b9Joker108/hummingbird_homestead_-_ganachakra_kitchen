# Hebrew Lexicon: An Introduction #



ה is the fifth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, often pronounced "hey" with an "h" sound like in "hat". It can function as a prefix meaning "the," be used to form questions, and also has grammatical uses, such as indicating direction. In Modern Hebrew, the sound of ה is often dropped at the beginning or middle of words in casual speech, but the letter is still written. Functions of the letter ה Definite article ("the"): When attached to the beginning of a noun, it functions as a definite article. For example, "יֶלֶד" (\(yeled\)) is "boy," but "הַיֶלֶד" (\(hayeled\)) is "the boy".Forming questions: It can be used to turn a statement into a question, similar to how some English words can be turned into questions by adding a question mark.Grammatical suffix: In its grammatical role as a suffix, ה can indicate direction toward a place, a function called ה׳ המגמה (the 'h' of destination). For example, "הַבַּיְתָה" (\(habayta\)) means "home" (in the sense of going towards it).Silent letter: At the end of a word, it can be silent and used to indicate a vowel, such as "יַלְדָּה" (\(yalda\)), "girl," where the ה is silent.Phonetic sound: In Modern Hebrew, the ה is often not pronounced in speech, but it is still written. For example, the word "הֵם" (\(hem\)), meaning "them," is often pronounced as /em/.
