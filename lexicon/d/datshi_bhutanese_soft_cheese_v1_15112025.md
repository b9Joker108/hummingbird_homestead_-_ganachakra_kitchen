# Datshi: Bhutanese Soft Cheese #

I am interested in making Bhutanese Cheese, particularly: 'Datshi' (Tibetan & Dzongkha: དར་ཚིལ་; Wylie: dar tshil) (Nishida, 2020: p. 37) which I understand was traditionally made from Himalayan Yak milk, but now is also often just made from lowland cow milk. I watched a Bhutanese lady (refer: https://youtu.be/O7Cnn62Xfb4?si=8Q13TCQRTnkuibMp) make what she called "Datshi", but it was a modern and derivative process of making Indian panir, with cow's milk heated till warm on a hob element, then she added white vinegar and gathered the curds together in a ball with hands in the whey of the pot on the hob with element heating. That may be what is now in some places termed Dashi and often used in contemporary Bhutanese households, but that isn't the traditional method. I understand that Datshi is traditionally made from buttermilk, not milk proper, and vinegar, of any kind, is of course not used. I am interested in producing small batches, for one, of the traditional product in my homestead kitchen to use in recipes, as I understand when cooked with, it has a different texture, flavour and culinary properties and qualities to modern processes of making Indian panir.

The traditional Bhutanese cheese Datshi is indeed distinct from Indian paneer and follows an artisanal process generally using fermented milk products rather than fresh milk and acidulation (vinegar). 

## Traditional Datshi Production
- Datshi is traditionally made from **buttermilk or the liquid residue left after churning butter (called "Mohi")**, not from fresh milk.
- The process begins by preparing **Dahi (curdled ferment milk)** from raw milk, which is then churned to produce artisanal butter ("Mar"). The liquid leftover from butter churning, "Mohi," is gently heated to coagulate casein proteins.
- This gentle heating causes curds to form naturally without the addition of vinegar or any acid. The curds are then collected in cloth and pressed to remove excess whey, forming cheese balls called Datshi.
- The flavor and texture are influenced by natural fermentation and mild heating, yielding a soft, tangy cheese that is distinct from fresh paneer.
- Datshi can be eaten fresh or further matured into another cheese called Zoety, but the starting point is always a fermented milk derivative rather than fresh milk coagulated by acidification.

## Modern and Shortcut Variant
- It is common now in many Bhutanese households to shortcut the process by using **fresh cow milk heated and curdled directly with vinegar or lemon juice**, similar to Indian paneer.
- This shortcut results in a firmer, less tangy product that is easier and quicker to make at home, but the taste and texture differ from traditional Datshi.
- The shortcut method involves heating milk till warm, adding white vinegar to curdle, and collecting curds into a ball in the whey while still on the stove.

## Summary and Recommendations for Small-batch Traditional Datshi at Home
- Aim to **start with fresh milk and culture it into buttermilk or dahi by fermentation** rather than directly using fresh milk.
- Then churn the fermented milk to get butter and use the leftover liquid (buttermilk) for cheese making.
- Gently heat this buttermilk without adding vinegar, allowing natural casein coagulation.
- Collect, press, and shape curds into cheese balls.
- This will produce the authentic texture and flavor associated with Bhutanese Datshi, more suited for cooking especially in traditional dishes like Ema Datshi.

If starting directly from fresh milk (especially cow milk), the shortcut method with vinegar is more practical, but it should be understood it is a derivative and not the original Datshi.

This traditional approach requires time to ferment and churn, but for small batches at home, fermenting milk to buttermilk or dahi first will be key to authenticity. Using yak milk is traditional but challenging outside the Himalayas; cow milk is an acceptable practical substitute when fermented properly.

These insights are synthesized from academic and cultural sources discussing Datshi's preparation, differences with paneer, and current household practices in Bhutan [1][2][3][4].

So, is Mohi, technically, 'buttermilk' or 'whey' or is the term traditionally used for both? Also, can you determine the Wylie and Uchen/Dzongkha for Mohi?

Mohi, in the context of traditional Bhutanese cheese making, refers specifically to the liquid residue left after churning butter from cultured milk—this is technically the buttermilk rather than whey[1]. In the process, milk is first fermented into dahi (yogurt), churned to separate out butter (Mar), and the remaining liquid is called Mohi. That Mohi is then gently heated to produce Datshi cheese. Therefore, Mohi is not the same as whey (which is the liquid left after curdling milk to form cheese); rather, it is traditional buttermilk derived from the butter-making stage, containing water, lactose, proteins, and remnants of milk solids[1].

For transliteration and script:
- The standard Wylie transliteration for Mohi is: **mo hi**.
- Dzongkha/Uchen (Tibetan script, used in Bhutan) would be: **མོ་ཧི་**.

So, Mohi is used for the buttermilk (not generic whey) in both traditional speech and technical cheesemaking in Bhutan. The distinction is important for getting authentic Datshi texture and flavor, as Mohi provides both light acidity and protein suitable for natural curdling when heated[1].

No, it seems like Mohi, is actually a Nepali and Hindi derived word for 'buttermilk' and the true Bhutanese term is: དརཝ་ (Nishida, 2020: p. 37)?

You are correct: "Mohi" (also spelled "mahi" or "mohi") is a loanword from Nepali and Hindi for buttermilk, and is widely used in Bhutanese vernacular, especially in regions with Nepali influence. However, the indigenous Dzongkha/Tibetan term for buttermilk, and the one used in traditional Bhutanese cheesemaking, is indeed "དརཝ་" (transliterated in Wylie as "dar wa" or simply "darwa")[2].

- "Mohi" refers specifically to buttermilk in both everyday and cheesemaking contexts, though it is not originally a native Bhutanese word.
- The proper Dzongkha (and Classical Tibetan) word for buttermilk as used in Bhutan is: དརཝ་ ("darwa" in Wylie transliteration).
- "Whey" in Tibetan/Dzongkha would be different, and not the same as buttermilk ("darwa"). Whey is what remains after milk is curdled and cheese is made, whereas buttermilk ("darwa") is the liquid left after churning butter from cultured milk[2][9].

Thus, for truly traditional and precise Bhutanese cheesemaking terminology, using དརཝ་ (darwa) for buttermilk is more authentic than "mohi," which is a borrowed term, even if widely used in everyday speech. This aligns both with scriptural and spoken practices in Bhutanese dairy culture[2][9].

Overview
This is a compact and reproducible recipe to churn two (2) litres of whole milk to make butter and collect the liquid buttermilk, then transform that buttermilk into traditional Bhutanese datshi (cheese) by heating and stirring in a contemporary kitchen. It follows the traditional sequence: make dahi/curd → churn to butter (yield butter + mohi/buttermilk) → heat buttermilk until coagulation to produce datshi. Expected final yields (approximate): butter 120–200 g; datshi 80–180 g depending on milk fat and how much solids remain in butter.

---

Equipment and ingredients
- 2 L whole milk (fresh, not UHT if possible)  
- Large heavy-bottomed saucepan or pot (3–4 L)  
- Thermometer (instant-read)  
- Clean glass or ceramic bowl (for cooling/holding curd)  
- Electric whisk, stand mixer, or jar for hand-shaking (for churning)  
- Fine-mesh strainer and cheesecloth (double-layer)  
- Large saucepan for heating buttermilk (2–3 L)  
- Wooden spoon or heatproof spatula for continuous stirring  
- Slotted spoon or small sieve for collecting curd lumps  
- Clean container for draining/forming datshi  
- Salt to taste (optional)  
- Ice water bath (bowl of iced water)  

---

Step 1 — Make curd (dahi) from 2 L milk
1. Pour 2 L milk into the large saucepan and slowly heat to 35–40 °C (body温). Remove from heat.  
2. Inoculate to set curd: either add 100–150 g plain live yogurt (starter) or 3–4 tbsp cultured buttermilk; stir gently to distribute.  
3. Cover and keep warm (25–35 °C) for 8–12 hours until firm set (jelly-like). Alternatively, place in oven with light on or insulated cooler to maintain gentle warmth.  
Notes: the traditional Bhutanese first step is to prepare dahi/curd from raw milk; this reproduces that at home.

---

Step 2 — Churn curd to make butter and collect buttermilk (mohi)
1. Once set, break curd into chunks and transfer to a mixing bowl.  
2. Use electric whisk or stand mixer at medium-high speed and whisk until the curd separates into butter lumps and liquid (buttermilk). This can take 3–8 minutes depending on equipment. If doing by hand, place curd in a jar and shake vigorously for 10–20 minutes.  
3. Drain the liquid (buttermilk / mohi) through cheesecloth into a clean bowl; reserve in the fridge if not using immediately.  
4. Rinse butter under cold running water and work out remaining buttermilk; shape and salt lightly if desired. Weigh or note butter yield (expect ~120–200 g from 2 L whole milk).  
Notes: the liquid residue (mohi/buttermilk) is the feedstock for datshi and is central to the traditional method.

---

Step 3 — Prepare for making datshi from buttermilk
- Use the buttermilk fresh or gently warmed; if chilled, bring it to room temperature.  
- Measure volume: expect roughly 1.6–1.8 L of liquid after churning (varies by how dry the butter is). Top up with a little water or thin yogurt whey if volume is insufficient — traditional recipes accept modest dilution.

---

Step 4 — Heat-and-stir coagulation to produce datshi
1. Transfer buttermilk (mohi) to the large saucepan. Place over medium-low heat. Attach thermometer.  
2. Slowly bring the buttermilk to 70–85 °C while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Avoid rapid boil; maintain a gentle rolling simmer at most.  
3. As the liquid heats, proteins will begin to coagulate into small curd clumps; keep stirring to agglomerate them into larger curds while preventing scorching on the bottom.  
4. When curds form and separate from a clearer whey (appearance: small to medium curds floating in pale whey), reduce heat to low and continue stirring gently for 5–15 minutes to allow curds to firm. Typical coagulation begins around 70–80 °C depending on acidity and solids.  
5. Use a slotted spoon or fine sieve to collect curd lumps (datshi). Transfer to cheesecloth-lined colander to drain; press lightly for a firmer texture. Season with salt if desired. Form into small balls or a loose crumbly cheese.  

Cultural note: the traditional datshi is the clumped curds formed when the buttermilk is heated and stirred; drain and press to shape.

---

Timing and temperatures (quick reference)
- Milk heating to inoculate: 35–40 °C.  
- Set curd incubation: 8–12 h at ~25–35 °C.  
- Churning: 3–20 min depending on method.  
- Buttermilk heating for datshi: slowly to 70–85 °C; coagulation usually appears 70–80 °C.  
- Continuous stirring required during entire heat-up and coagulation phase to avoid burning and to produce even curds.

---

Troubleshooting
- No curd set after 12 h: starter inactive or milk overheated before inoculation; restart with fresh active yogurt starter.  
- Butter fails to form: curd too fresh or not acidic enough; allow curd to rest longer or agitate more vigorously.  
- Buttermilk won’t coagulate: acidity too low; add 1–2 tbsp of lemon juice or vinegar, or a small amount of yogurt to acidify, then heat gently — curds should form.  
- Scorching on bottom: use heavy-bottom pot and constant stirring; reduce heat and use an oil-slick (thin layer) of water to keep curds moving.  
- Texture too soft/watery: drain longer, press lightly, or heat a bit longer at low temperature to consolidate curds.

---

Yields, storage, and uses
- Butter: use immediately or store in the fridge up to 1 week; freeze for long-term.  
- Datshi: store refrigerated in airtight container 3–7 days; for traditional use, it is often added directly to dishes like ema datshi (chili-cheese). Reheat gently in stews or melt into sauces.  
- Whey leftover after datshi: nutritious, usable for soups, rising bread, or fermentation starters.

Traditional practice summary
Bhutanese herders used both yak and cow milk but rarely stored large volumes as raw milk for long — milk was transformed quickly into cultured and preserved forms (yogurt/curd, butter, and several types of cheese) to extend shelf life and support transport and trade.

Why they transformed milk quickly
- High-altitude, warm-season milking produced more milk than could be consumed fresh and refrigeration was absent, so fermentation and fat separation were the practical preservation strategies.  
- Culturing (making dahi/curd) acidified the milk, making it less perishable and providing the feedstock for churning into butter and for heating the resultant buttermilk to form cheeses like datshi and chugo.  

Typical products and workflows
- Butter and mohi/buttermilk: fresh milk or curd was churned to yield butter (a valuable food and trade good) and the liquid buttermilk, which was then transformed into cheeses by heating or drying.  
- Chugo (dried yak cheese) and fresh cheeses: yak milk was often processed into dense, shelf-stable cheeses or dried products for winter use and for market sale.  
- Fermented curds/yogurt: used as both a direct food and a starter culture for subsequent batches, maintaining a chain of cultured transformation rather than prolonged storage of raw milk.

Practical implication for a contemporary kitchen
In reproducing traditional Bhutanese methods you should assume the historically normal pathway: convert raw milk quickly into a cultured product (curd/dahi) then churn or heat that curd/buttermilk into butter and cheeses, rather than expecting to store large quantities of raw milk safely for later use.

### Empowering Yak Herders in Dagala through Cheese Production and Livelihood Diversification  
**Supported by the Bhutan Foundation**

The Dagala Yak Cooperative, operating under the Bhutan Yak Federation, consists of 39 households engaged in yak rearing, managing around 2,400 yaks. These semi-nomadic herders, living in the Dungdro and Wangdro chiwogs of Dagala Gewog in Thimphu District, depend largely on yak-derived products such as milk, meat, and wool, alongside some earnings from tourism. In 2022, despite facing challenges due to the region’s harsh climate and remote location, the cooperative achieved remarkable production figures: 177,876 liters of milk, 7.3 metric tons of butter, 0.5 metric tons of cheese, and 12 metric tons of chugo, a traditional dried yak cheese.

To improve the livelihoods of these resilient herders, the Dagala Yak Cooperative partnered with the National Highland Development Center (NHDC) to initiate a project focused on diversifying livestock products and delivering vital training. This initiative is generously supported by the Bhutan Foundation’s Small Grants Program.

Between August 15 and 24, 2024, 27 yak herders took part in an intensive 10-day training program on hygienic cheese processing. The training introduced them to the production of two premium yak cheeses, Tomme and Gumdel, which represent an innovative addition to their customary dairy practices. The participants warmly welcomed the training, with experienced herder Ms. Buthri, who has 33 years of experience, expressing enthusiasm about acquiring new skills and sharing this knowledge with her peers.

Beyond training, the project includes establishing a specialized cheese-processing facility in Dagala Gewog. This facility, managed jointly by the NHDC and the district livestock sector, aims to produce high-quality cheeses that will help diversify income sources for cooperative members and stimulate the local economy.

By equipping yak herders with enhanced skills and infrastructure, this project is fostering the sustainability of highland communities. The emphasis on value-added products like Tomme and Gumdel cheese is expected to open new economic avenues, lessen reliance on traditional income streams, and secure a more promising future for yak herders in Bhutan’s highlands.

The Bhutan Foundation’s Small Grants Program proudly supports this transformative effort, which holds great promise for improving the well-being of yak herders and their communities.
