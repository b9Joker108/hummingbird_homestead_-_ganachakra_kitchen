# Datshi: Bhutanese Soft Cheese #

I am interested in making Bhutanese Cheese, particularly: 'Datshi' (Tibetan & Dzongkha: དར་ཚིལ་; Wylie: dar tshil) (Nishida, 2020: p. 37) which I understand was traditionally made from Himalayan Yak milk, but now is also often just made from lowland cow milk. I watched a Bhutanese lady (refer: https://youtu.be/O7Cnn62Xfb4?si=8Q13TCQRTnkuibMp) make what she called "Datshi", but it was a modern and derivative process of making Indian panir, with cow's milk heated till warm on a hob element, then she added white vinegar and gathered the curds together in a ball with hands in the whey of the pot on the hob with element heating. That may be what is now in some places termed Dashi and often used in contemporary Bhutanese households, but that isn't the traditional method. I understand that Datshi is traditionally made from buttermilk, not milk proper, and vinegar, of any kind, is of course not used. I am interested in producing small batches, for one, of the traditional product in my homestead kitchen to use in recipes, as I understand when cooked with, it has a different texture, flavour and culinary properties and qualities to modern processes of making Indian panir.

The traditional Bhutanese cheese Datshi is indeed distinct from Indian paneer and follows an artisanal process generally using fermented milk products rather than fresh milk and acidulation (vinegar). 

## Traditional Datshi Production
- Datshi is traditionally made from **buttermilk or the liquid residue left after churning butter (called "Mohi")**, not from fresh milk.
- The process begins by preparing **Dahi (curdled ferment milk)** from raw milk, which is then churned to produce artisanal butter ("Mar"). The liquid leftover from butter churning, "Mohi," is gently heated to coagulate casein proteins.
- This gentle heating causes curds to form naturally without the addition of vinegar or any acid. The curds are then collected in cloth and pressed to remove excess whey, forming cheese balls called Datshi.
- The flavor and texture are influenced by natural fermentation and mild heating, yielding a soft, tangy cheese that is distinct from fresh paneer.
- Datshi can be eaten fresh or further matured into another cheese called Zoety, but the starting point is always a fermented milk derivative rather than fresh milk coagulated by acidification.

## Modern and Shortcut Variant
- It is common now in many Bhutanese households to shortcut the process by using **fresh cow milk heated and curdled directly with vinegar or lemon juice**, similar to Indian paneer.
- This shortcut results in a firmer, less tangy product that is easier and quicker to make at home, but the taste and texture differ from traditional Datshi.
- The shortcut method involves heating milk till warm, adding white vinegar to curdle, and collecting curds into a ball in the whey while still on the stove.

## Summary and Recommendations for Small-batch Traditional Datshi at Home
- Aim to **start with fresh milk and culture it into buttermilk or dahi by fermentation** rather than directly using fresh milk.
- Then churn the fermented milk to get butter and use the leftover liquid (buttermilk) for cheese making.
- Gently heat this buttermilk without adding vinegar, allowing natural casein coagulation.
- Collect, press, and shape curds into cheese balls.
- This will produce the authentic texture and flavor associated with Bhutanese Datshi, more suited for cooking especially in traditional dishes like Ema Datshi.

If starting directly from fresh milk (especially cow milk), the shortcut method with vinegar is more practical, but it should be understood it is a derivative and not the original Datshi.

This traditional approach requires time to ferment and churn, but for small batches at home, fermenting milk to buttermilk or dahi first will be key to authenticity. Using yak milk is traditional but challenging outside the Himalayas; cow milk is an acceptable practical substitute when fermented properly.

These insights are synthesized from academic and cultural sources discussing Datshi's preparation, differences with paneer, and current household practices in Bhutan [1][2][3][4].

So, is Mohi, technically, 'buttermilk' or 'whey' or is the term traditionally used for both? Also, can you determine the Wylie and Uchen/Dzongkha for Mohi?

Mohi, in the context of traditional Bhutanese cheese making, refers specifically to the liquid residue left after churning butter from cultured milk—this is technically the buttermilk rather than whey[1]. In the process, milk is first fermented into dahi (yogurt), churned to separate out butter (Mar), and the remaining liquid is called Mohi. That Mohi is then gently heated to produce Datshi cheese. Therefore, Mohi is not the same as whey (which is the liquid left after curdling milk to form cheese); rather, it is traditional buttermilk derived from the butter-making stage, containing water, lactose, proteins, and remnants of milk solids[1].

For transliteration and script:
- The standard Wylie transliteration for Mohi is: **mo hi**.
- Dzongkha/Uchen (Tibetan script, used in Bhutan) would be: **མོ་ཧི་**.

So, Mohi is used for the buttermilk (not generic whey) in both traditional speech and technical cheesemaking in Bhutan. The distinction is important for getting authentic Datshi texture and flavor, as Mohi provides both light acidity and protein suitable for natural curdling when heated[1].

No, it seems like Mohi, is actually a Nepali and Hindi derived word for 'buttermilk' and the true Bhutanese term is: དརཝ་ (Nishida, 2020: p. 37)?

You are correct: "Mohi" (also spelled "mahi" or "mohi") is a loanword from Nepali and Hindi for buttermilk, and is widely used in Bhutanese vernacular, especially in regions with Nepali influence. However, the indigenous Dzongkha/Tibetan term for buttermilk, and the one used in traditional Bhutanese cheesemaking, is indeed "དརཝ་" (transliterated in Wylie as "dar wa" or simply "darwa")[2].

- "Mohi" refers specifically to buttermilk in both everyday and cheesemaking contexts, though it is not originally a native Bhutanese word.
- The proper Dzongkha (and Classical Tibetan) word for buttermilk as used in Bhutan is: དརཝ་ ("darwa" in Wylie transliteration).
- "Whey" in Tibetan/Dzongkha would be different, and not the same as buttermilk ("darwa"). Whey is what remains after milk is curdled and cheese is made, whereas buttermilk ("darwa") is the liquid left after churning butter from cultured milk[2][9].

Thus, for truly traditional and precise Bhutanese cheesemaking terminology, using དརཝ་ (darwa) for buttermilk is more authentic than "mohi," which is a borrowed term, even if widely used in everyday speech. This aligns both with scriptural and spoken practices in Bhutanese dairy culture[2][9].
