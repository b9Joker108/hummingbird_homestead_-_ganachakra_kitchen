# Confit: An Introduction #

Confit is a French cooking method for preserving food by slow-cooking it in fat or oil at a low temperature. The term means "to preserve" and the technique is historically a preservation method that also makes the food incredibly tender. It is most famously used for duck or chicken, but can also be applied to vegetables like garlic and tomatoes, or even fruit preserved in sugar. 

What confit is:

* A preservation technique: The primary origin of confit is as a way to preserve food for long periods. Slow-cooking in fat creates an environment that prevents bacterial growth.
* A cooking method: While its origin is preservation, "confit" is now also used to describe the process of cooking something slowly in fat or oil at a low temperature, even if it's not intended for long-term storage.
* Different from deep-frying: Confit is cooked at much lower temperatures than deep-frying. For example, duck confit is cooked gently at around 90-95°C, whilst deep-frying can be between 165-230°C.
* Examples of confit Meat: Duck confit is a classic example, where duck legs are first cured, then slowly cooked in duck fat. The result is a very tender meat that can be crisped up by pan-frying before serving.
* Vegetables: Vegetables can be confited in oil, such as garlic or tomatoes. The slow cooking process in oil makes them soft and mellows their flavor.Fruit: Fruit can also be preserved as a confit by cooking it slowly in sugar.
