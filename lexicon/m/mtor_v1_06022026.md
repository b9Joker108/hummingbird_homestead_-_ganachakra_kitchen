# Mechanistic target of Rapamycin (mTOR) #

Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a central master regulator of cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and autophagy in response to nutrients, energy, and growth factors. Operating through two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, it controls protein synthesis and cell survival, with deregulation linked to cancer, diabetes and aging. 

**Pease tell me all about: mTOR?**

mTOR, or mechanistic target of rapamycin, is a key protein kinase that acts as a central regulator of cell growth, metabolism, and survival by sensing nutrients, energy levels, and growth factors like insulin.[1][3] It forms two main complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which control processes such as protein synthesis, autophagy, and cytoskeletal organization.[1][6]

**Core Functions**

mTOR integrates signals from amino acids, glucose, oxygen, and growth factors to promote anabolic processes like protein synthesis and lipid production when nutrients are abundant.[1][3] It inhibits autophagy (cellular recycling) via mTORC1 during fed states but allows it during starvation for maintenance.[1][7] mTORC2 supports cell survival by activating pathways like Akt and regulating ion transport.[3]

**Biological Roles**

In physiology, mTOR drives tissue growth in muscle, liver, fat, and brain, influencing synaptic plasticity for learning and memory.[1][5] In plants, it aids root growth and embryogenesis; across eukaryotes, it's conserved for metabolism control.[1][4]

**Health Implications**

Hyperactive mTOR links to cancer (e.g., via unchecked proliferation), diabetes, obesity, and neurodegeneration like Alzheimer's.[1][2][3] It's implicated in aging through senescence promotion, but inhibition boosts repair and reduces infections in the elderly.[1]

**Inhibitors and Therapies**

Rapamycin derivatives like temsirolimus and everolimus target mTORC1 for cancers such as renal cell carcinoma, impairing tumor angiogenesis.[1][2] These also show anti-aging potential by enhancing autophagy and longevity pathways.[1][7]

**Relevance to Fitness**

Given your interest in advanced training like kettlebells and biomechanics, mTOR activation via amino acids (e.g., leucine) and resistance exercise drives muscle protein synthesis for hypertrophy.[1][7] Intermittent fasting or low-mTOR states (e.g., ketosis) may enhance recovery and autophagy, balancing growth with repair in your routine.[7]
