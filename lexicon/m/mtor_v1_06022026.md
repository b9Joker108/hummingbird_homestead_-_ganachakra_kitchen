# Rapamycin (mTOR) #

Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a central master regulator of cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and autophagy in response to nutrients, energy, and growth factors. Operating through two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, it controls protein synthesis and cell survival, with deregulation linked to cancer, diabetes and aging.
