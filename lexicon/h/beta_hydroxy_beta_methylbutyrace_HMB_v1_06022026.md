# Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrace (HMB) #

Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrace (HMB). This is a strong cofactor for Leucine and also Magnesium. Interrogate and specify protocols.

**HMB (β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate) supports muscle preservation as a leucine metabolite, aiding protein synthesis and reducing breakdown during training.** It activates similar pathways to leucine like mTOR but via distinct mechanisms, with evidence strongest for recovery in untrained or stressed states.[1][2][3]

## Leucine Relationship
HMB forms from leucine breakdown (about 5% conversion), acting as its active metabolite to enhance muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and inhibit breakdown independently of insulin.[1][4] While leucine triggers stronger acute mTOR signaling, HMB uniquely attenuates damage in high-intensity scenarios like kettlebell work; no direct synergy requires separate dosing.[5][2]

## Magnesium Role
No evidence positions magnesium as a direct HMB cofactor; leucine signaling doesn't hinge on it like some enzymes do.[6][7] Some commercial blends pair HMB with magnesium for general recovery (e.g., 120mg/dose), but peer-reviewed data lacks specific protocols—prioritize evidence over combos given your NAFLD and evidence preferences.[8]

## Supplementation Protocols
Standard dose: 3g/day HMB (free acid or calcium salt), split 1g three times with meals for steady levels; start 2+ weeks pre-training for benefits.[9][10]

| Form | Timing | Context | Notes |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| HMB-Ca | 60-120min pre-workout | General fitness | Steady absorption[11] |
| HMB-FA | 30-60min pre-workout | Kettlebell/HIIT | Faster peak[9] |
| With leucine | Post-workout (3-5g leucine) | Muscle repair | Complementary, not required[1] |

For your kettlebell flows and NAFLD, pair with protein-rich meals (e.g., leucine sources like whey); monitor liver markers as data is limited in metabolic conditions.[12][13] Consult a clinician before starting.
