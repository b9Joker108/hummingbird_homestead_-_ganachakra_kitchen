# Diya #

## Introduction ##

I was of the understanding that a brass lamp for puja or altarwork is a diya, but there are actually other more appropriate technical terms? Mine is surmounted by a peacock and has a number of tiers and circa twently individual lamp units?

A brass lamp used for puja or altar work can be called a *diya* when it is a simple single or few-wick lamp. However, your description—a multi-tiered lamp surmounted by a peacock and comprising around twenty individual lamps—points to a more specific and elaborate category of traditional lamps used in Hindu rituals.

### Possible Technical Terms for Your Lamp

- **Deepalakshmi or Kuthuvilakku:**  
  These are brass or bronze lamps typically holding multiple wicks, used in household or temple pujas. *Deepalakshmi* lamps often feature the goddess Lakshmi, while *Kuthuvilakku* refers to a traditional standing lamp [5][8].

- **Deepastambha or Deepa Stambha (Lamp Tower):**  
  Multi-tiered lamp towers common in temples, with numerous small lamps arranged in tiers around a central stem. They can be elaborately decorated, sometimes featuring animal or bird motifs like the peacock [5].

- **Deepavriksha (Tree of Light):**  
  Lamps designed like branching trees holding multiple diyas—this term captures multi-tier, branching structures with several lamps [5].

- **Ashtothira Deepam:**  
  A sacred lamp with 108 lights arranged in tiers, often symbolizing divine or cosmic significance, and sometimes ornamented with birds and floral motifs [1].

- **Jhari Batti:**  
  Hanging or multi-tiered lamps used in temple decoration with tiers of lamps, occasionally depicting auspicious symbols or animals [1].

### Your Lamp

Given it is multi-tiered, has about twenty lamps, and is surmounted by a peacock, your lamp is likely a variety of **Deepastambha or Deepavriksha**, ornamented with symbolic motifs popular in temple and household worship, with the peacock being an auspicious bird linked to Lord Krishna and other deities.

***

### Summary

- *Diya* is the generic term, often for single-wick oil lamps.  
- Multi-tiered lamps with multiple diyas and decorative motifs are often called **Deepa Stambha, Deepavriksha, or Ashtothira Deepam** depending on design and regional tradition.  
- The presence of a peacock and many tiers aligns with the **Deepastambha** or elaborate ceremonial lamps used in ritual worship.

If desired, I can help you with detailed cultural and symbolic meanings of these lamps and guides on their ritual use.

Samai Diwali Deepak — overview

A Samai (also spelled samay or samayi) or Deepak is a traditional oil lamp used in South Indian and pan‑Indian ritual contexts, especially during Diwali and puja ceremonies. The Kerala style “samai” is a standing brass lamp with one or more shallow bowls or tiers for coconut‑or sesame oil and cotton wicks; it’s also called kutthu vilakku or deepam in regional usage.

---

Common types and materials

- Brass standing Kerala samai (single‑ or multi‑tier) — durable, polished finish.  
- Handheld clay or brass diya — small, for rangoli and home use.  
- Multi‑arm brass deepam (panchdeep) — used in temple and ceremonial lighting.  
- Decorative modern variants in copper, bronze, or brass with engraved motifs.

You can find ready‑made brass Kerala samai / Diwali deepak offerings from multiple sellers and marketplaces.

---

How to prepare and light (practical steps)

1. Clean lamp: wipe dust; polish brass if needed.  
2. Add oil: fill the bowl(s) with purified sesame oil, gingelly oil, or coconut oil up to safe level.  
3. Prepare wick: roll cotton into a compact wick, one end anchored inside the bowl so the tip rests above the oil surface.  
4. Light: ignite the wick carefully with a match or long lighter, lighting from the top wick downward if multi‑tiered.  
5. Placement: set on a stable, heat‑resistant surface away from curtains and foot traffic.

---

Ritual placement and timing

- Place near the home altar or at the entrance to welcome auspiciousness.  
- During Diwali, lamps are traditionally lit at dusk and kept burning through the evening as part of the festival of lights.  
- In puja rites, the lamp may be waved (arati) before deities or maintained as an ever‑burning symbol of knowledge and devotion.

---

Safety and upkeep

- Never leave burning lamps unattended.  
- Use a tray or plate underneath to catch oil drips.  
- Trim or replace wicks as they char; refill oil when low.  
- For tall standing samai, ensure the base is stable and away from children or pets.  
- Clean periodically with mild vinegar or brass polish to prevent corrosion.

---

Buying and care tips

- Prefer solid brass for longevity; check for soldered joints on multi‑tier lamps.  
- Look for even machining/handwork and a stable base; inspect bowls for uniform depth.  
- If purchasing online, confirm dimensions and weight to ensure stability in your home setting.  
- Store unlit lamps in a dry place; keep spare cotton wicks and a small bottle of ritual oil with the lamp for convenience.

---

Short ritual note (for archival use)

Record the lamp’s provenance (maker, material, date purchased), any ritual modifications (added tiers, engraved motifs), and care protocol (polish schedule, oil type) as part of your object‑level metadata for future stewardship.


## Traditional Cleaning ##

To traditionally clean a brass diya, use a paste made of equal parts lemon juice and baking soda, or a solution of equal parts white vinegar and salt, to gently scrub the tarnished areas with a soft cloth. After applying the solution and letting it sit, rinse thoroughly with warm water and dry immediately with a soft cloth to restore its shine and prevent new tarnish. 

**Traditional Cleaning Methods**

**Method 1: Lemon Juice and Baking Soda**

* Create a paste: Mix equal parts lemon juice and baking soda to form a paste.
* Apply and scrub: Gently apply the paste to the brass diya with a soft cloth, paying attention to intricate areas. Let it sit for about 15 minutes to work on the tarnish.
* Rinse and dry: Rinse the diya thoroughly with warm water, ensuring all paste is removed. Immediately dry it completely with a clean, soft cloth.

**Method 2: Vinegar, Salt and Water**

* Create a cleaning solution: Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a bowl. For more stubborn tarnish, you can add a tablespoon of salt.
* Submerge or soak: Place the diya in the solution, or if it's a large item, soak it for 15 to 30 minutes depending on the tarnish.
* Scrub gently: Remove the diya and gently scrub it with a soft cloth.
* Rinse and dry: Rinse it under warm water and dry it immediately and completely to prevent water spots.

**Important tips**

* Use soft cloths: Always use a soft, dry cloth for dusting and a soft cloth or brush for cleaning to avoid scratching the surface.
* Avoid harsh chemicals: Do not use harsh chemical cleaners or abrasive materials like steel wool, as they can damage the brass.
* Dry thoroughly: Moisture can cause brass to tarnish, so always ensure the diya is completely dry after cleaning before storing or using it again.
* Store properly: When not in use, store the diya in a dry place, wrapped in a soft cloth, or in an airtight container to slow down tarnishing. 


Ghee lamps for altarwork — quick overview

Below is a practical, documentation‑ready protocol for converting your two‑tier, 24‑diyas lamp (peacock/hamsa finial) into ghee candles with cotton wicks suitable for sustained altar use, plus conservation and ritual notes to record with the object.

---

Materials and preparation

- Ghee: Purified, clarified butter (cow/plant clarified alternative if required). Use fresh, food‑grade ghee kept in a clean, dry container.  
- Wicks: 100% cotton yarn or twisted cotton wick; pre‑made cotton wicks are acceptable.  
- Tools: small stainless steel ladle; heat source; double boiler or small saucepan; metal or heat‑resistant bowl; skewers or clothespins to hold wicks; tray for spills; soft cloth for cleaning.  
- Lamp prep: clean each diya bowl of dust and old oil; ensure no solder cracks at joints; place lamp on a stable, heat‑resistant base.

---

Making and sizing wicks

- Type: tightly twisted cotton gives a steady flame; flat braided wicks burn slower.  
- Length: cut wicks ~2–3 cm longer than bowl rim so tip sits ~5–8 mm above bowl when anchored.  
- Anchor method: roll one end into a small nub that sits in the ghee; or use a small dab of molten ghee to fix the wick base in the bowl while it cools.  
- Pre‑soak: for even lighting, pre‑soak wicks briefly in melted ghee then let excess drip off before final placement.

---

Preparing ghee for filling

1. Warm ghee gently in a double boiler until fully liquid (no bubbling) to avoid overheating.  
2. Filter through a fine sieve if any milk solids remain.  
3. Keep ghee warm but not hot while filling to avoid spattering.

---

Filling and lighting procedure

1. Place lamp on a tray; insert and anchor all wicks first (do not light yet).  
2. Carefully pour warm ghee into each diya bowl, leaving ~3–5 mm headspace from rim to reduce spill risk.  
3. Reposition wick tip to stand slightly above the ghee; steady with a skewer or clothespin until set.  
4. Light at dusk or per ritual timing: ignite each wick from a single source (use long lighter or taper) working clockwise if following customary directional practice.  
5. Maintain an eye on the flame for the first 10–15 minutes to ensure even burning; adjust wick length if smoking or sooting appears.

---

Expected burn behavior and wick adjustment

- Burn time: small shallow diyas filled with ghee typically burn several hours depending on bowl volume; test one bowl to measure typical duration for your lamp.  
- Flame height: ideal steady flame ~1–2 cm high; if higher, trim wick slightly; if lower or sputtering, replace or re‑seat wick and ensure ghee is clean.  
- Soot/smoke: heavy smoke → wick too long or contaminated ghee; trim to 5–8 mm above ghee surface and relight.

---

Safety and conservation

- Never leave unattended. Keep away from drafts, curtains, children, and pets.  
- Drip tray: always use a tray sized for the lamp to catch ghee spills.  
- Heat: two‑tiered lamps concentrate heat; check base temperature and allow periodic cooling to avoid stress on soldered joints.  
- Conservation note: repeated heating can darken or stress brass; schedule gentle cleaning and rest periods; avoid abrasive polishes near joints and the finial.

---

Ritual and archival metadata to record

- Provenance: where/when purchased, maker if known.  
- Set status: recorded as formerly a pair; note that set was voluntarily broken and reason for single use.  
- Description: two‑tier brass lamp; finial described as peacock or hamsa; 24 diyas (count each bowl) — photograph top, profile, base, and finial.  
- Materials: brass; soldered joints present/absent; type of wick used; ghee as fuel.  
- Care protocol: ghee fill procedure, polish schedule (e.g., gentle cleaning every 3 months), storage conditions, handling instructions.  
- Ritual notes: preferred lighting time, directional practice, any mantras or dedications used while lighting.

---

Short practical checklist (on altar day)

- Clean lamp and tray; inspect stability.  
- Prepare and pre‑soak wicks.  
- Warm and filter ghee.  
- Anchor wicks, pour ghee, adjust tips.  
- Light from single source, monitor first 15 minutes.  
- Extinguish by gentle snuffer or allow to burn down; never blow.

Risks and first principle

Removing patina alters the object’s surface, historic integrity, and market/heritage value. For an antique brass lamp these are the main risks: loss of original finish, exposure of softer metal or hidden repairs, accelerated corrosion after cleaning, and accidental damage to soldered joints or the finial. If the lamp will remain in ritual use, weigh ritual preference against conservation value and record every intervention in your object metadata.

---

Decision options (choose one)

- Conservator approach — retain patina; stabilise; minimal cleaning (recommended for antiques).  
- Selective reduction — clean high-touch areas only, leaving most patina intact.  
- Full bright‑polish — remove patina completely for an even shiny finish (highest risk; requires care).

---

Preparatory steps

- Photograph: capture high‑resolution images of finial, tiers, bowls, base, solder joints, and any maker’s marks.  
- Record metadata: current patina description, dimensions, weight, noted damages, provenance, why you are altering it.  
- Test area: pick an inconspicuous spot (underside of base or inner rim) and perform a small test to observe appearance and any reaction.  
- Workspace: well‑ventilated, stable table, soft padding, good light, tray to catch runoff.  
- Safety: gloves (nitrile), eye protection, avoid open flames near ghee residues.

---

Gentle conservation workflow (preferred)

1. Dry dusting: use a soft natural‑hair brush and a vacuum with a micro‑suction (low) or gentle puffing to remove loose dust and grit.  
2. Non‑aqueous wipe: a lint‑free cotton cloth lightly dampened with IMS (industrial methylated spirit) or high‑grade ethanol can remove oils and surface grime without water—test first.  
3. Mechanical surface cleaning: use cotton swabs and dental‑grade nylon brushes to work around details and solder lines; avoid metal scrapers.  
4. Light brightening (if test patch acceptable): make a paste of finely powdered calcium carbonate (chalk) or non‑scratch jeweller’s rouge with a few drops of ethanol; gently rub with a soft cotton or microfiber cloth in the direction of casting marks. Rinse cloth frequently.  
5. Final wipe: clean with ethanol on a fresh lint‑free cloth to remove residues; allow to air dry fully.  
6. Protective microcoat: apply a very thin layer of microcrystalline wax (e.g., Renaissance Wax) warmed with your palm and buff lightly to protect the cleaned surface.

Notes: stop at the first sign of metal colour change, pitting, or loss of fine detail. Do not use strong acids (vinegar, lemon) or abrasive powdered cleaners on antique brass.

---

Stronger cleaning (if you choose full polish — high risk)

- Materials: commercial brass polish (non‑ammoniated preferred), soft cotton buffing wheels or cloths.  
- Method: follow product instructions; work small areas; avoid solder joints and the finial base; immediately remove polish residues; finish with microcrystalline wax.  
- Caution: repeated polishes thin decorative surfaces and remove maker’s marks and tool marks.

---

Solder joints, finial, and two‑tier risks

- Heat and mechanical stress from aggressive rubbing can loosen soldered joints.  
- Finial (peacock/hamsa) details are often thin; avoid heavy abrasion there.  
- For multi‑tier objects, support the lamp during cleaning so tiers are not stressed.

---

Post‑treatment documentation and care

- Update object record with before/after photos, materials and methods used, test patch location and date, and reason for intervention.  
- Allow occasional resting periods; avoid continuous daily lighting after bright polishing to reduce thermal cycling stress.  
- Reapply microcrystalline wax every 6–12 months or after heavy handling.  
- Store in stable humidity (around 40–55%) and away from sulfurous atmospheres.

---

If you prefer professional help

Seek a qualified metal conservator for full de‑patination or if the lamp has structural instability, repairs, or high market/provenance value. Conservators can provide reversible treatments and full condition reports.

---

Practical recommendation

If you value the lamp’s antiquity, choose the gentle conservation workflow or selective reduction and protect the result with microcrystalline wax. If your ritual practice requires a bright finish and you accept the loss of patina and increased conservation needs, proceed with the stronger cleaning but limit it to a single careful intervention and document everything.

If you want, I can convert this into a one‑page laminated conservation checklist and a short entry you can paste into your object metadata.



Ritual priority: suci (ritual purity) over provenance

If the lamp’s primary role is as a vehicle for offering to the hearth‑Goddess and you value ritual purity (suci) above conserving an antique finish, your choices shift from “preserve patina” to “make clean, safe, and suitable for continuous sacred use.” Below is a concise, practical protocol that balances effective surface cleaning, structural safety, and clear minimal documentation so future caretakers understand what was done.

---

Quick verdict
- Follow a conservative-but-effective cleaning that removes soils and residues likely to contaminate offerings, avoids structural harm to the two‑tier lamp and finial, and finishes with a protective layer so the lamp functions well in ritual use.  
- Do not use strong acids (vinegar/lemon) or aggressive abrasives that can pock or thin antique brass.

---

Materials you will need
- Soft natural‑hair brush; soft lint‑free cloths; cotton swabs.  
- Food‑grade ghee (for later fueling), small stainless ladle.  
- High‑grade ethanol or IMS (methylated spirits) for degreasing.  
- Fine non‑abrasive polishing paste (calcium carbonate/chalk or jeweller’s rouge) only if you want brightening.  
- Microcrystalline wax (Renaissance Wax) or thin beeswax for a sacramentally acceptable protective finish.  
- Nitrile gloves; tray; skewers/clothespins for wicks; long lighter.  
- Camera or phone for two simple photos (before, after).

---

Cleaning protocol (ritual‑oriented, stepwise)

1. Visual check and photography  
   - Photograph lamp top and base; note any loose solder or cracks. If joints look fragile, stop and seek a conservator.  

2. Dry dust removal  
   - Brush loose dust into a tray and sweep away. Use cotton swabs for crevices around the finial and solder lines.  

3. Degrease and remove old oil/residue  
   - Wear gloves. Lightly dampen a lint‑free cloth or swab with ethanol and wipe each bowl and the exterior. Work gently around the finial and solder. Repeat until no greasy film remains. Allow to air dry.  

4. Test patch for brightening (optional)  
   - If you want a brighter surface, test a small hidden area (underside of base) with a tiny paste of calcium carbonate + ethanol or a jeweller’s rouge. Buff very gently in the direction of casting marks; stop immediately if surface becomes too bright, pitted, or if solder seams show stress. Wipe clean with ethanol.  

5. Final surface protection suitable for ritual use  
   - Warm a fingertip amount of microcrystalline wax and apply a very thin coat over external surfaces (avoid wax inside the bowls where ghee will sit). Buff until satin. Beeswax can substitute if you prefer a wholly natural product; microcrystalline wax gives longer protection.  

6. Clean bowls only where ghee will be placed  
   - Before filling, wipe the inside of each diya bowl with ethanol and then with a lint‑free cloth. If you used wax externally, ensure no wax residue remains inside bowls.

---

Fueling and first consecrated offering (suci steps)

1. Use clean, food‑grade ghee warmed and filtered. Pre‑soak and anchor cotton wicks per your earlier protocol.  
2. Fill each bowl leaving safe headspace; stabilize wicks; light as your practice prescribes.  
3. For consecration: perform your customary short ritual (water, akshata, mantras, incense, or smoke passing) before lighting if that is part of your hearth tradition. A simple act of intention and offering while lighting suffices in most domestic rites.  
4. After the first ritual use, monitor for smoking or sooting; trim wicks as needed.

---

Safety and structural notes
- Two‑tier lamps concentrate heat; avoid continuous burn of all 24 bowls for extended periods. Consider lighting a subset for daily practice and the full set for special observances.  
- Use a wide drip tray and place the lamp on a heat‑resistant surface away from drafts and flammable textiles.  
- Inspect solder seams after the first few uses for any signs of loosening.

---

Minimal metadata to record (even if provenance is not valuable)
- Date and brief reason for intervention (e.g., “03‑11‑2025; cleaned for ritual suci; patina deliberately reduced on exterior”).  
- Treatments performed (degreased with ethanol; optional brightening at test patch; exterior microcrystalline/beeswax application).  
- Any observed structural issues and their status.  
- Photograph after treatment and a note of preferred ritual use (e.g., “daily: 6 diyas; festival: all 24 diyas”).

Practical recommendation
If your aim is devotional clarity and ongoing use, the above conservative cleaning + protective wax gives you a clean, sacral vehicle without needless risk to structure. If you decide later to remove all patina aggressively, record that as a separate, high‑risk intervention and consider consulting a conservator first.

If you want, I can convert the cleaning + consecration steps into a single laminated altar card formatted for your lamp (one side: quick cleaning checklist; other side: fueling and lighting checklist).



Lemon and baking soda on brass — short caution

Lemon juice is acidic and baking soda is alkaline. Together they can remove grime and patina but also etch, pit, or strip thin surfaces and compromise soldered joints on antique brass. If your priority is sacramental cleanliness over conserving patina, proceed only with extreme care, testing first and documenting every step.

Safer ritual workflow using lemon and baking soda

Preparation
- Record two photos and a short note of condition before cleaning.  
- Test patch under the base or inside an inconspicuous area.  
- Workspace: stable tray, soft padding, good light, nitrile gloves, eye protection, clean water supply, soft lint‑free cloths, cotton swabs, small bowls.  
- Materials: fresh lemon juice; fine baking soda; soft toothbrush or soft cotton cloth; distilled water for final rinsing; clean food‑grade ghee for fueling; microcrystalline wax or beeswax for exterior protection.

Test patch procedure
1. Mix a tiny paste of baking soda and just enough lemon juice to make a soft paste.  
2. Apply a pea‑size amount to the test patch with a cotton swab and rub gently for no more than 5–10 seconds.  
3. Immediately rinse with distilled water and dry.  
4. Inspect under good light for colour change, mattting, pitting, or stressed solder lines.  
5. If any adverse change appears, stop and use the gentler ethanol + chalk method previously described.

If test patch is acceptable proceed only with this controlled method
1. Work in short runs: clean no more than 2–3 bowls or a single small area at a time.  
2. Apply paste thinly with a cotton swab or soft cloth; rub very gently following the casting marks; avoid the finial and solder seams.  
3. Limit contact time to under 10 seconds per spot.  
4. Rinse each cleaned area immediately with plenty of distilled water to neutralise acid and alkaline residues.  
5. Dry thoroughly with a lint‑free cloth and then air dry in a warm, dust‑free place.  
6. Repeat selectively only where necessary; do not aim for an all‑over bright polish in one session.

Neutralisation and protection after cleaning

- Neutralise: after rinsing, wipe with a cloth dampened with a little diluted baking soda solution (1 teaspoon in 250 ml distilled water) to neutralise residual acid, then rinse again with distilled water.  
- Drying: ensure complete dryness; use gentle warm air or a hairdryer on low at safe distance to avoid thermal shock to solder.  
- Protect: avoid putting wax inside bowls; apply a very thin microcrystalline wax or a light beeswax coat to exterior surfaces only; buff to a satin finish.

---

Ritual hygiene and fuel safety

- Ensure no cleaning residue remains inside bowls before adding ghee. Wipe bowls with ethanol and then with a clean dry cloth.  
- First filling: use strained food‑grade ghee warmed and poured carefully; anchor pre‑soaked cotton wicks.  
- Subset lighting: for daily practice light fewer bowls to reduce thermal stress; use all 24 only for special observances.

Documentation to record now

- Date and reason for intervention: e.g., “03‑11‑2025; cleaned with lemon + baking soda for ritual suci.”  
- Test patch location and result.  
- Areas cleaned and methods (times and contact durations).  
- Any observed metal changes and subsequent action.  
- Recommended follow up: inspect solder seams after three uses; reapply wax every 6–12 months.

Final practical note

Using lemon and baking soda can achieve the sattvik brightening you want but carries measurable risk to antique brass. The controlled, tested, minimal approach above preserves ritual purity while limiting harm. If you observe any solder movement, pitting, or unexpected colour change, stop further treatment and switch to non‑abrasive degreasing and protective wax.

Drying and neutralisation — short answer

Yes — thorough rinsing with clean water followed by immediate, complete drying is essential. Rinse removes acids and salts; prompt drying prevents residual moisture or salts from causing corrosion or staining.

Practical step‑by‑step (fast ritual workflow)

1. Rinse: after using lemon+bicarb, rinse each cleaned area immediately and thoroughly with plenty of distilled or very clean tap water.  
2. Neutralise: wipe surfaces once with a cloth dampened in a mild baking‑soda solution (1 tsp NaHCO3 in 250 ml water), then rinse again.  
3. Towel dry: blot with a clean, lint‑free cloth to remove surface water.  
4. Forced dry: use warm (not hot) air — hairdryer on low at 20–30 cm — or place in a warm, dry room until every recess is bone dry.  
5. Crevices and solder lines: tilt and inspect; use cotton swabs to carry water out of tight spots and dry them immediately.  
6. Final wipe: wipe bowls and exterior with a cloth lightly moistened with high‑grade ethanol to displace water and speed evaporation.  
7. Protect: do not wax inside bowls; apply a very thin microcrystalline or beeswax coat to exterior only, buff to satin.  
8. Wait before fueling: allow 24 hours in a dry location to ensure no trapped moisture before adding ghee.

Quick cautions

- Do not leave the lamp to air‑dry in a humid or dusty place.  
- Avoid trapped water at the base of the finial or inside solder seams.  
- If any white salt residue appears, repeat neutralisation and drying until gone.
