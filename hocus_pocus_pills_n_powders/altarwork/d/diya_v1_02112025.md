# Diya #

## Traditional Cleaning ##

To traditionally clean a brass diya, use a paste made of equal parts lemon juice and baking soda, or a solution of equal parts white vinegar and salt, to gently scrub the tarnished areas with a soft cloth. After applying the solution and letting it sit, rinse thoroughly with warm water and dry immediately with a soft cloth to restore its shine and prevent new tarnish. 

**Traditional Cleaning Methods**

**Method 1: Lemon Juice and Baking Soda**

* Create a paste: Mix equal parts lemon juice and baking soda to form a paste.
* Apply and scrub: Gently apply the paste to the brass diya with a soft cloth, paying attention to intricate areas. Let it sit for about 15 minutes to work on the tarnish.
* Rinse and dry: Rinse the diya thoroughly with warm water, ensuring all paste is removed. Immediately dry it completely with a clean, soft cloth.

**Method 2: Vinegar, Salt and Water**

* Create a cleaning solution: Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a bowl. For more stubborn tarnish, you can add a tablespoon of salt.
* Submerge or soak: Place the diya in the solution, or if it's a large item, soak it for 15 to 30 minutes depending on the tarnish.
* Scrub gently: Remove the diya and gently scrub it with a soft cloth.
* Rinse and dry: Rinse it under warm water and dry it immediately and completely to prevent water spots.

**Important tips**

* Use soft cloths: Always use a soft, dry cloth for dusting and a soft cloth or brush for cleaning to avoid scratching the surface.
* Avoid harsh chemicals: Do not use harsh chemical cleaners or abrasive materials like steel wool, as they can damage the brass.
* Dry thoroughly: Moisture can cause brass to tarnish, so always ensure the diya is completely dry after cleaning before storing or using it again.
* Store properly: When not in use, store the diya in a dry place, wrapped in a soft cloth, or in an airtight container to slow down tarnishing.
