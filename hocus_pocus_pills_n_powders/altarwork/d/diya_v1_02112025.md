# Diya #

## Introduction ##

I was of the understanding that a brass lamp for puja or altarwork is a diya, but there are actually other more appropriate technical terms? Mine is surmounted by a peacock and has a number of tiers and circa twently individual lamp units?

A brass lamp used for puja or altar work can be called a *diya* when it is a simple single or few-wick lamp. However, your description—a multi-tiered lamp surmounted by a peacock and comprising around twenty individual lamps—points to a more specific and elaborate category of traditional lamps used in Hindu rituals.

### Possible Technical Terms for Your Lamp

- **Deepalakshmi or Kuthuvilakku:**  
  These are brass or bronze lamps typically holding multiple wicks, used in household or temple pujas. *Deepalakshmi* lamps often feature the goddess Lakshmi, while *Kuthuvilakku* refers to a traditional standing lamp [5][8].

- **Deepastambha or Deepa Stambha (Lamp Tower):**  
  Multi-tiered lamp towers common in temples, with numerous small lamps arranged in tiers around a central stem. They can be elaborately decorated, sometimes featuring animal or bird motifs like the peacock [5].

- **Deepavriksha (Tree of Light):**  
  Lamps designed like branching trees holding multiple diyas—this term captures multi-tier, branching structures with several lamps [5].

- **Ashtothira Deepam:**  
  A sacred lamp with 108 lights arranged in tiers, often symbolizing divine or cosmic significance, and sometimes ornamented with birds and floral motifs [1].

- **Jhari Batti:**  
  Hanging or multi-tiered lamps used in temple decoration with tiers of lamps, occasionally depicting auspicious symbols or animals [1].

### Your Lamp

Given it is multi-tiered, has about twenty lamps, and is surmounted by a peacock, your lamp is likely a variety of **Deepastambha or Deepavriksha**, ornamented with symbolic motifs popular in temple and household worship, with the peacock being an auspicious bird linked to Lord Krishna and other deities.

***

### Summary

- *Diya* is the generic term, often for single-wick oil lamps.  
- Multi-tiered lamps with multiple diyas and decorative motifs are often called **Deepa Stambha, Deepavriksha, or Ashtothira Deepam** depending on design and regional tradition.  
- The presence of a peacock and many tiers aligns with the **Deepastambha** or elaborate ceremonial lamps used in ritual worship.

If desired, I can help you with detailed cultural and symbolic meanings of these lamps and guides on their ritual use.

Samai Diwali Deepak — overview

A Samai (also spelled samay or samayi) or Deepak is a traditional oil lamp used in South Indian and pan‑Indian ritual contexts, especially during Diwali and puja ceremonies. The Kerala style “samai” is a standing brass lamp with one or more shallow bowls or tiers for coconut‑or sesame oil and cotton wicks; it’s also called kutthu vilakku or deepam in regional usage.

---

Common types and materials

- Brass standing Kerala samai (single‑ or multi‑tier) — durable, polished finish.  
- Handheld clay or brass diya — small, for rangoli and home use.  
- Multi‑arm brass deepam (panchdeep) — used in temple and ceremonial lighting.  
- Decorative modern variants in copper, bronze, or brass with engraved motifs.

You can find ready‑made brass Kerala samai / Diwali deepak offerings from multiple sellers and marketplaces.

---

How to prepare and light (practical steps)

1. Clean lamp: wipe dust; polish brass if needed.  
2. Add oil: fill the bowl(s) with purified sesame oil, gingelly oil, or coconut oil up to safe level.  
3. Prepare wick: roll cotton into a compact wick, one end anchored inside the bowl so the tip rests above the oil surface.  
4. Light: ignite the wick carefully with a match or long lighter, lighting from the top wick downward if multi‑tiered.  
5. Placement: set on a stable, heat‑resistant surface away from curtains and foot traffic.

---

Ritual placement and timing

- Place near the home altar or at the entrance to welcome auspiciousness.  
- During Diwali, lamps are traditionally lit at dusk and kept burning through the evening as part of the festival of lights.  
- In puja rites, the lamp may be waved (arati) before deities or maintained as an ever‑burning symbol of knowledge and devotion.

---

Safety and upkeep

- Never leave burning lamps unattended.  
- Use a tray or plate underneath to catch oil drips.  
- Trim or replace wicks as they char; refill oil when low.  
- For tall standing samai, ensure the base is stable and away from children or pets.  
- Clean periodically with mild vinegar or brass polish to prevent corrosion.

---

Buying and care tips

- Prefer solid brass for longevity; check for soldered joints on multi‑tier lamps.  
- Look for even machining/handwork and a stable base; inspect bowls for uniform depth.  
- If purchasing online, confirm dimensions and weight to ensure stability in your home setting.  
- Store unlit lamps in a dry place; keep spare cotton wicks and a small bottle of ritual oil with the lamp for convenience.

Short ritual note (for archival use)

Record the lamp’s provenance (maker, material, date purchased), any ritual modifications (added tiers, engraved motifs), and care protocol (polish schedule, oil type) as part of your object‑level metadata for future stewardship.


## Traditional Cleaning ##

To traditionally clean a brass diya, use a paste made of equal parts lemon juice and baking soda, or a solution of equal parts white vinegar and salt, to gently scrub the tarnished areas with a soft cloth. After applying the solution and letting it sit, rinse thoroughly with warm water and dry immediately with a soft cloth to restore its shine and prevent new tarnish. 

**Traditional Cleaning Methods**

**Method 1: Lemon Juice and Baking Soda**

* Create a paste: Mix equal parts lemon juice and baking soda to form a paste.
* Apply and scrub: Gently apply the paste to the brass diya with a soft cloth, paying attention to intricate areas. Let it sit for about 15 minutes to work on the tarnish.
* Rinse and dry: Rinse the diya thoroughly with warm water, ensuring all paste is removed. Immediately dry it completely with a clean, soft cloth.

**Method 2: Vinegar, Salt and Water**

* Create a cleaning solution: Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a bowl. For more stubborn tarnish, you can add a tablespoon of salt.
* Submerge or soak: Place the diya in the solution, or if it's a large item, soak it for 15 to 30 minutes depending on the tarnish.
* Scrub gently: Remove the diya and gently scrub it with a soft cloth.
* Rinse and dry: Rinse it under warm water and dry it immediately and completely to prevent water spots.

**Important tips**

* Use soft cloths: Always use a soft, dry cloth for dusting and a soft cloth or brush for cleaning to avoid scratching the surface.
* Avoid harsh chemicals: Do not use harsh chemical cleaners or abrasive materials like steel wool, as they can damage the brass.
* Dry thoroughly: Moisture can cause brass to tarnish, so always ensure the diya is completely dry after cleaning before storing or using it again.
* Store properly: When not in use, store the diya in a dry place, wrapped in a soft cloth, or in an airtight container to slow down tarnishing. 


Ghee lamps for altarwork — quick overview

Below is a practical, documentation‑ready protocol for converting your two‑tier, 24‑diyas lamp (peacock/hamsa finial) into ghee candles with cotton wicks suitable for sustained altar use, plus conservation and ritual notes to record with the object.

---

Materials and preparation

- Ghee: Purified, clarified butter (cow/plant clarified alternative if required). Use fresh, food‑grade ghee kept in a clean, dry container.  
- Wicks: 100% cotton yarn or twisted cotton wick; pre‑made cotton wicks are acceptable.  
- Tools: small stainless steel ladle; heat source; double boiler or small saucepan; metal or heat‑resistant bowl; skewers or clothespins to hold wicks; tray for spills; soft cloth for cleaning.  
- Lamp prep: clean each diya bowl of dust and old oil; ensure no solder cracks at joints; place lamp on a stable, heat‑resistant base.

---

Making and sizing wicks

- Type: tightly twisted cotton gives a steady flame; flat braided wicks burn slower.  
- Length: cut wicks ~2–3 cm longer than bowl rim so tip sits ~5–8 mm above bowl when anchored.  
- Anchor method: roll one end into a small nub that sits in the ghee; or use a small dab of molten ghee to fix the wick base in the bowl while it cools.  
- Pre‑soak: for even lighting, pre‑soak wicks briefly in melted ghee then let excess drip off before final placement.

---

Preparing ghee for filling

1. Warm ghee gently in a double boiler until fully liquid (no bubbling) to avoid overheating.  
2. Filter through a fine sieve if any milk solids remain.  
3. Keep ghee warm but not hot while filling to avoid spattering.

---

Filling and lighting procedure

1. Place lamp on a tray; insert and anchor all wicks first (do not light yet).  
2. Carefully pour warm ghee into each diya bowl, leaving ~3–5 mm headspace from rim to reduce spill risk.  
3. Reposition wick tip to stand slightly above the ghee; steady with a skewer or clothespin until set.  
4. Light at dusk or per ritual timing: ignite each wick from a single source (use long lighter or taper) working clockwise if following customary directional practice.  
5. Maintain an eye on the flame for the first 10–15 minutes to ensure even burning; adjust wick length if smoking or sooting appears.

---

Expected burn behavior and wick adjustment

- Burn time: small shallow diyas filled with ghee typically burn several hours depending on bowl volume; test one bowl to measure typical duration for your lamp.  
- Flame height: ideal steady flame ~1–2 cm high; if higher, trim wick slightly; if lower or sputtering, replace or re‑seat wick and ensure ghee is clean.  
- Soot/smoke: heavy smoke → wick too long or contaminated ghee; trim to 5–8 mm above ghee surface and relight.

---

Safety and conservation

- Never leave unattended. Keep away from drafts, curtains, children, and pets.  
- Drip tray: always use a tray sized for the lamp to catch ghee spills.  
- Heat: two‑tiered lamps concentrate heat; check base temperature and allow periodic cooling to avoid stress on soldered joints.  
- Conservation note: repeated heating can darken or stress brass; schedule gentle cleaning and rest periods; avoid abrasive polishes near joints and the finial.

---

Ritual and archival metadata to record

- Provenance: where/when purchased, maker if known.  
- Set status: recorded as formerly a pair; note that set was voluntarily broken and reason for single use.  
- Description: two‑tier brass lamp; finial described as peacock or hamsa; 24 diyas (count each bowl) — photograph top, profile, base, and finial.  
- Materials: brass; soldered joints present/absent; type of wick used; ghee as fuel.  
- Care protocol: ghee fill procedure, polish schedule (e.g., gentle cleaning every 3 months), storage conditions, handling instructions.  
- Ritual notes: preferred lighting time, directional practice, any mantras or dedications used while lighting.

---

Short practical checklist (on altar day)

- Clean lamp and tray; inspect stability.  
- Prepare and pre‑soak wicks.  
- Warm and filter ghee.  
- Anchor wicks, pour ghee, adjust tips.  
- Light from single source, monitor first 15 minutes.  
- Extinguish by gentle snuffer or allow to burn down; never blow.
