Usage, Safety, and Ceramic Thread Saliences

- Heating compatibility  
  - Electric ceramic stove, electric stove, and gas stove: suitable.  
  - Induction cooker: not suitable (central icon crossed out).  
  - Maximum recommended electric‑stove power: ≤ 1200 W.  
- Thermal performance  
  - Rated thermal endurance: 450–500°C (manufacturer claim).  
  - Key ceramic attributes: low thermal expansion; high mechanical strength; thermal shock resistance; corrosion resistance; wear resistance.  
- Food safety claim  
  - Manufacturer asserts compliance with U.S. FDA standards; retain original test reports or SGS certificates for archival verification.  
- Standards of interest for archival record  
  - GB 4806.4‑2016 (national food contact materials safety standard component).  
  - QB/T 2250‑2018 (industry product standard).  
  - ISO9001:2015 (quality management system certification for manufacturer).  
- Operational cautions  
  - Do not use on induction cookers.  
  - When using electric hotplates, ensure power ≤ 1200 W.  
  - Avoid sudden extreme cooling after high‑temperature exposure to minimize risk of thermal shock despite claimed resistance.  
  - Inspect for hairline cracks before each use; discard on crack detection.  
- Archival ceramic thread notes  
  - Preserve original certificate, label, and any SGS/FDA test reports as separate scanned assets.  
  - Record kiln‑run marks, glaze crazing, and any potting‑shrinkage numerals on the pot base in the physical object log.  
  - Photograph icon array (top view, front view) to show crossed‑out induction icon for UX provenance.

If you wish, I will commit this as a raw GFM file named KS‑CROCK‑ARCHIVE.md in your Homestead Kitchen repository content block and generate a compact printable bilingual label layout (single‑column) suitable for 60 mm × 40 mm adhesive tags. Which would you prefer next: commit the .md file content as shown, or produce the printable label layout?

Update: Oven suitability report

---

Summary
- Finding: The product label includes an oven icon indicating the crockpot is suitable for oven use in addition to electric ceramic stove, electric stove, and gas stove.  
- Action: Archive record and label templates must be updated to reflect oven suitability, and operational cautions should be expanded to cover oven‑specific use and safety.

---

Bilingual statement to add to archived metadata and the product label
- 中文: 可用于烤箱  
- English: Suitable for oven use

---

Revised compact identification block (bilingual, paste‑ready)
- 产品名称: 康舒耐热陶瓷炖锅 — Product name: Kangshu Heat‑Resistant Ceramic Crockpot  
- 容量: 4 L — Capacity: 4 L  
- 加热方式: 电陶炉; 电炉; 燃气炉; 烤箱 — Heating methods: Electric ceramic stove; Electric stove; Gas stove; Oven  
- 电磁炉: 不适用（图标划去） — Induction cooker: Not suitable (icon crossed out)  
- 电器炉在1200W以内使用 — Use electric appliances up to 1200 W

---

Operational implications for archival and user guidance
- Include oven‑use guidance on the product page and printed label: preheat policy, maximum internal oven temperature if available, recommended placement (middle rack), and handling gloves type (silicone/oven mitts rather than thin disposable gloves).  
- Explicitly warn against placing the ceramic directly on exposed flame if instruction differs for gas stoves versus oven racks; prefer using a trivet or oven‑safe tray for even heat distribution and to protect the pot base.  
- Retain manufacturer claimed thermal tolerance (450–500°C) in archival notes but mark it as manufacturer claim pending verification from SGS/FDA/third‑party test reports.

---

Safety and preservation notes for archival use
- For archival cooking tests, use incremental temperature ramps (e.g., 100°C steps) and photograph for provenance.  
- Do not expose to rapid cooling after high‑temperature oven use; allow gradual cooling to limit thermal shock despite rated resistance.  
- Record any glaze crazing, crazes propagation, or base deformation after oven cycles in the object log.

---

Label and repository corrections (applied)
- Removed unrelated glove entry from certificate text.  
- Added explicit bilingual oven suitability line.  
- Retained crossed‑out induction icon statement.  
- Added “Capacity: 4 L” line to identification.

---

Final archival note
- Preserve scans/photos of the icon array emphasizing the oven icon and the crossed‑out induction icon for UX provenance.  
- Flag the manufacturer thermal rating and FDA claim for documentary verification; attach SGS/FDA reports to the archival record when available.
