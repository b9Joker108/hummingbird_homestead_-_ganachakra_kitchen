# Roe #

Wild hake roe, the egg masses of the female hake fish, is an edible and highly appreciated delicacy in many parts of the world, particularly in Southern Europe and South Africa. It has a mild, delicate and concentrated marine flavour with a texture that is firm yet creamy, sometimes described as a bit gritty. 

**Culinary Uses and Preparation**

Hake roe is very versatile and can be prepared in numerous ways: 
* Fried (a popular method in Andalusia, Spain).
* Boiled and served in salads or with mayonnaise or vinaigrette.
* Grilled or lightly sautéed with garlic and parsley as a warm tapa.
* Added to paellas, creamy rice dishes or pasta for added flavor and texture.
* Served on toast as an appetizer.
* Used to make pâtés.

**Caution**

When cooking fresh roe, some caution is needed, as whole roe can sometimes burst if deep-fried without first being cut into pieces or scored. 

**Nutritional Benefits**

Hake roe is a nutritious food, known for being: 
* Rich in high-quality protein.
* A good source of omega-3 fatty acids, beneficial for cardiovascular and brain health.
* Low in fat and calories.
* Packed with essential minerals like phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium, and B vitamins, including B12.

**Availability**

Wild hake roe is available fresh from fish markets during the hake's breeding season and can also be purchased frozen or canned year-round. Canned hake roe is typically preserved in olive oil or its own juice, often with a hint of chili, and is a popular and convenient preserved product.
