# Roe: An Introduction #

One of the most memorable secular or restaurant meals I have ever had was in the early days of Pearl's openning in Richmond, Australia. I started with an entree drawn from the dessert menu of traditional handmade rose Persian 'fairyfloss' of such scent, flavour and texture, it altered me. I requested them to make the entree of assorted fish roe of main size, which they furnished, without question. I was on a fulltime three (3) month project placement with a subsidiary of BP and we were on a team-building Christmas lunch, before leave, for Christmas proper. I ate the roe individually. Most of the roe were quite large, like berries, and there were a bounty of different kinds of generous amount and they adorned some fish and fruit like. It presented like a large polychromatic salad. I ate it with my fingers as I did with the floss and platter. I favour eating with my hands, over utensils, as a strong personal predilection. All of the colours, like glinting jewells were a sight. I still see them vividly in my memory after all these years. The rose and roe commingling on my palate was notable and unexpected. The roe transported me by each juice explosion dispersing in a burst throughout the entirety of my mouth. For dessert proper, I had a small cheese and fruit platter and macchiato coffee: strong and long. My morning coffee, as standard, is a French press with a stain of pure cream, a mote of raw honey and often cinnamon, sometimes mace or other warm spices. I don't generally have coffee after noon unless wilting and I needsmust be be bright-eyed.

What wild-caught fish roe is available fresh in Melbourne, Australia, and when?

Wild-caught fish roe available fresh in Melbourne includes roe from seasonal wild fish such as King Dory, which is available at certain times like Fridays when in season. Mullet roe is harvested from wild sea mullet (Mugil Cephalus) mainly from April to August, sourced on the East Coast of Australia including Victoria. Other wild roe types commonly found include salmon roe (from wild Pacific salmon varieties), trout roe, herring roe, cod roe, and sea urchin roe, though sourcing may vary by season and supplier.

Specifically:
- King Dory roe is seasonally available in abundance, for example noted for availability at certain seafood stores.
- Wild sea mullet roe is harvested pre-spawning April through August.
- Various salmon and trout roe are commonly available wild-caught, including fresh Atlantic salmon roe and varieties from the Pacific coast.
- Other roe like herring, cod, and sea urchin roe are also part of wild product offerings but less seasonally specific.

These roes may appear fresh depending on seasonality and fishery regulations. Seasonality is crucial as roe is typically harvested close to spawning periods. Melbourne seafood suppliers and fishmongers often stock these roes fresh according to the catch cycle, with wild fish and roe traced from the boat to kitchen to ensure freshness.

This coverage is based on seafood supply details from Melbourne-area specialty fishmongers and suppliers, reflecting local seasonal availability patterns for wild-caught fish roe [1][2][5][6][10].

# Roe #

Wild hake roe, the egg masses of the female hake fish, is an edible and highly appreciated delicacy in many parts of the world, particularly in Southern Europe and South Africa. It has a mild, delicate and concentrated marine flavour with a texture that is firm yet creamy, sometimes described as a bit gritty. 

**Culinary Uses and Preparation**

Hake roe is very versatile and can be prepared in numerous ways: 
* Fried (a popular method in Andalusia, Spain).
* Boiled and served in salads or with mayonnaise or vinaigrette.
* Grilled or lightly sautéed with garlic and parsley as a warm tapa.
* Added to paellas, creamy rice dishes or pasta for added flavor and texture.
* Served on toast as an appetizer.
* Used to make pâtés.

**Caution**

When cooking fresh roe, some caution is needed, as whole roe can sometimes burst if deep-fried without first being cut into pieces or scored. 

**Nutritional Benefits**

Hake roe is a nutritious food, known for being: 
* Rich in high-quality protein.
* A good source of omega-3 fatty acids, beneficial for cardiovascular and brain health.
* Low in fat and calories.
* Packed with essential minerals like phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium, and B vitamins, including B12.

**Availability**

Wild hake roe is available fresh from fish markets during the hake's breeding season and can also be purchased frozen or canned year-round. Canned hake roe is typically preserved in olive oil or its own juice, often with a hint of chili, and is a popular and convenient preserved product.
