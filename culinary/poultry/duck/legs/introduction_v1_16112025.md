# Duck Legs: An Introduction #

If you’re holding four duck legs, you’ve got the makings of some of the world’s most iconic dishes. The global canon for duck legs centers on slow-cooking, braising, and confit—methods that turn this richly flavored cut into tender, luxurious meals.  

Here’s a curated harvest of the most celebrated recipes worldwide:

- Why iconic: It embodies French preservation traditions and is a cornerstone of southwestern French cuisine.

🇨🇳 China – Red-Cooked Duck Legs / Peking Duck Adaptations
- Signature: While Peking duck is traditionally whole, duck legs are often braised in soy sauce, star anise, ginger, and Shaoxing wine (“hong shao ya”).  
- Context: This method yields glossy, aromatic legs with deep umami.  
- Why iconic: It’s part of the broader Chinese repertoire of red-braising, a technique applied to pork belly and duck alike.
