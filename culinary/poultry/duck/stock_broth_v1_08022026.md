### Why these fields?
- `title` → overrides the H1 for Dataview, graph view, etc.
- `created` / `updated` → standard Obsidian date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for sorting/queries.
- Hierarchical tag `culinary/poultry/duck` → matches your folder structure and makes Dataview/folder queries easy.
- `aliases` → lets you link to it from anywhere with nicer names.
- `description` → shows up nicely in Dataview tables or hover previews.
- `source` + `version` → useful for your homestead/kitchen log style.

If you use any of the popular recipe plugins (Recipe View, Cooking, etc.) and want extra fields like `yield`, `cook_time`, etc., just let me know and I’ll add them.

Drop it in, and your note is now fully Obsidian-native. Happy homesteading! 🦆✨

# Duck broth/stock #

Your first whole-duck hack sounds like a total win—tender meat, crispy skin potential from the broil, and a bonus pot of rich stock as the payoff. That simmer-first-then-broil method (very close to classic techniques for rendering fat while keeping the bird juicy) is smart for a home cook, especially on attempt #1.

Your stock is cooling right now, so here are the **practical “rules”** for turning it into excellent duck broth/stock. Duck broth is basically chicken stock’s richer, fattier cousin—deeper flavor, more gelatin, and a ton of usable fat on top.

### Immediate Next Steps (While It’s Cooling)
1. Let it come down to room temp (don’t fridge it piping hot if it’s a big volume—risk of warming the whole fridge).  
2. Once it’s cool enough, fridge it uncovered or loosely covered overnight.  
3. Tomorrow: a thick layer of duck fat will have solidified on top. Scoop it off gently (spoon or spatula). This is **liquid gold**—save every bit in a jar. It keeps in the fridge 1–2 months or freezer 6+ months. Use it for roasting potatoes, frying eggs, making confit, or brushing on veggies.  
4. Strain the stock through a fine sieve (or lined with paper towel/cheesecloth for extra clarity). Any remaining foam or bits go in the bin.

### Core Rules for Duck Broth
- **Skim, always** — During any future simmering, skim foam/scum early. Duck fat rises fast; never stir once veggies are in (keeps it clearer).  
- **Go low and slow** — Bare simmer (tiny bubbles), never a rolling boil. 4–8 hours (or overnight in a slow cooker/Instant Pot on low) extracts maximum collagen and flavor. Your initial simmer was probably shorter (common in the “tender duck” hack), so the broth might be lighter—totally fine, just more delicate.  
- **Aromatics matter** — If yours only has the basics from the simmer (onion/carrot/celery/herbs), it’s good. Next time add: bay leaves, thyme, peppercorns, garlic, maybe a strip of orange zest or star anise for an Asian twist. Add them in the last 1–2 hours so they stay bright.  
- **Defat properly** — The fridge trick is the easiest. Leftover fat in the stock isn’t a crime (adds mouthfeel), but removing most of it lets the broth last longer and taste cleaner.  
- **Reduce if you want power** — Taste after defatting. If it’s mild, simmer uncovered to concentrate (can turn into a glossy demi-glace).  
- **Salt late** — Season only when you’re about to use it. Stocks reduce, so oversalting early is a pain.

### Storage Rules
- Fridge: 4–5 days (defatted lasts longer).  
- Freezer: 3–6 months in airtight containers or ice-cube trays (great for grabbing a shot for sauces). Leave headspace—stock expands.  
- Pro move: pressure-can it if you have the gear (10 psi, 25 min for pints).

### What to Do With It Now
- Simple duck soup: reheat some broth, add shredded leftover duck meat, noodles/rice, ginger, scallions, a splash of soy or sherry.  
- Risotto or polenta base.  
- Braise greens, lentils, or beans in it.  
- Reduce + butter for a quick pan sauce.  
- Freeze most of it; you’ll be glad later when you want duck-flavored anything without buying another bird.

You basically turned one duck into meat + fat + stock. That’s pro-level resourcefulness. Next time you can roast the carcass briefly before the long simmer if you want a darker, roastier broth (brown stock style), but honestly your current batch is already a winner.

Enjoy the fat—seriously, it’s the best part of the whole project. Let me know what you end up making with the broth! 🦆
