# Duck #

Quick guide — what to decide first
- Goal: Braised Chinese-style duck on the hob in a covered ceramic pot.  
- Key choices: flavour profile (Cantonese soy-sweet; Teochew/lor ark darker, spiced), skin (leave on for richness or remove for leaner result), pre-blanch (recommended to remove blood/impurities).  
- Constraints you gave: duck will be cut to fit a ceramic pot with lid and cooked on a stovetop.

Comparison of two common Chinese stovetop braise styles
| Style | Flavor | Key aromatics/spices | Cook time | Best for ceramic pot |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| Cantonese braised duck | Savoury, slightly sweet, clean | Ginger; scallion; light + dark soy; rock sugar | 1.5–2 hours | Excellent; gentle simmer preserves texture.  |
| Teochew / Lor Ark | Dark, deeply soy‑spiced, slightly herbal | Dark soy; five‑spice/star anise; garlic; Shaoxing wine | 1.5–2 hours (or pressure cook faster) | Excellent; long, low simmer develops colour and aroma.  |

Ingredients (for 1 whole duck, cut up; serves 4)
- 1 whole duck (about 1.8–2.5 kg), thawed and cut into pieces to fit your pot.  
- Aromatics: 4–6 slices ginger; 3–4 scallions (cut into 5 cm lengths); 4–6 garlic cloves smashed.  
- Sauces & seasoning: 3 tbsp light soy sauce; 2 tbsp dark soy sauce (for colour); 2–3 tbsp Shaoxing wine or dry sherry; 1–2 tbsp rock sugar or 1 tbsp brown sugar.  
- Spices (choose by style): 2 star anise + 1 small cinnamon stick (Teochew); or just ginger/scallion for Cantonese.  
- Oil for searing; water or low‑salt stock to barely cover pieces.  
- Optional: a few slices of taro or daikon; a knob of young ginger if available.

Step‑by‑step method for a ceramic pot on the hob

1. Prep and safety
1. Fully thaw the duck in the fridge; pat dry with paper towels. Ensure no ice crystals remain.  
2. Cut into pieces: remove wings, legs, and cut the body into 4–6 pieces so they sit flat in the pot. Keep bones — they add flavour.  
3. Trim excess fat under the skin if you want less grease, but keep most skin for flavour.

2. (Optional but recommended) Blanch to clean
- Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Add duck pieces for 30–60 seconds to remove blood/impurities. Remove, rinse under warm water, and pat dry. This gives a cleaner braise and firmer skin. 

3. Brown / render fat
- Heat 1–2 tbsp oil in your ceramic pot over medium‑high. Add duck pieces skin‑side down to render some fat and get light colour, 3–6 minutes. Do in batches if needed. Remove excess fat if it’s a lot (leave a tablespoon for flavour).

4. Build the braising liquid
- Lower heat to medium. Add ginger, scallion, garlic and spices; stir briefly until fragrant.  
- Add Shaoxing wine to deglaze (sizzle for 20–30 seconds).  
- Add light soy + dark soy + rock sugar and stir to dissolve.  
- Pour in enough water or stock to come about 2/3 up the pieces (not fully submerging is fine). Bring to a gentle boil. 

5. Simmer gently, covered
- Once boiling, reduce to low heat so the liquid barely simmers. Cover with the lid.  
- Cook time: 1.5–2 hours depending on duck size. Turn pieces every 20–30 minutes so colour and flavour distribute evenly. For very tender meat, cook until meat pulls easily from bone. 

6. Finish and glaze
- When tender, remove lid and increase heat to reduce the sauce to a glossy glaze (5–10 minutes). Spoon the reduced sauce over the duck to coat. If you prefer a thicker sauce, remove duck and reduce liquid further, then return duck to coat.

7. Rest and serve
- Let the duck rest 5–10 minutes. Serve with steamed rice, plain noodles, or taro rice; garnish with sliced scallion or coriander.

Temperature and doneness (food safety)
- Duck should be cooked until meat is tender and juices run clear. For safety, poultry internal temperature should reach 74°C (165°F) at the thickest part; braised duck is usually cooked longer until tender rather than relying solely on thermometer reading. Use a thermometer if you want to be exact.

Troubleshooting & tips
- Too greasy: skim fat during cooking; refrigerate leftovers and remove solidified fat from the surface before reheating.  
- Bitter or too salty: add a little water and a teaspoon of sugar; balance with a splash of rice vinegar at the end if needed.  
- Skin soggy: to crisp skin, transfer pieces to a hot pan skin‑side down for a minute or briefly broil (if oven available).  
- Pot care: ceramic pots retain heat—keep simmer low to avoid scorching. Use a heat diffuser if your hob has very high direct heat.

Serving & storage
- Serve: with steamed rice, pickled vegetables, or stir‑fried greens. Leftovers are great in fried rice or noodle soups.  
- Store: refrigerate within 2 hours; keeps 3–4 days. Reheat gently in a pot with a splash of water to avoid drying.

If you want, I can now:
- Give a precise ingredient list and scaled timings for the exact weight of your duck; or  
- Write a short shopping list for the aromatics and sauces; or  
- Walk you through the first 20 minutes live (what to look for while searing and starting the braise).
