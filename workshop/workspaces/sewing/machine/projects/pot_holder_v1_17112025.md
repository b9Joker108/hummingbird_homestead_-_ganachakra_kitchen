# Pot Holder #

I cannot find often mitts or pot-holders that I like. So, now I have the new sewing machine and sewing sheers, I am going to make my own. Well, it will likely be the second project. The obligatory first project, is of course, a pin cushion.

Felted 100% wool from an upcycled sweater is an excellent and naturally heat-resistant material for potholders. By washing a 100% wool sweater in hot water and drying it in an electric dryer on high heat, will cause the wool fibers to felt and interlock, creating a dense, durable and heat-resistant batting. 

**How to felt a wool sweater for potholders**

* Find a 100% wool sweater: Look for a sweater made of 100% wool at a thrift store. Synthetic blends will not felt properly.
* Wash on hot: Wash the sweater in a washing machine set to the highest hot setting. 
* Dry on hot: After washing, dry the sweater on a hot setting in the dryer. You may need to run it through another hot wash and dry cycle to achieve the desired density.
* Check the density: You will see the sweater shrink and become denser. Once it has reached a thickness and density that you are happy with, it is ready to be cut and sewn into potholders.
* Cut and sew: Cut the felted wool into desired shapes for your potholders. You can use one or more layers of the felted wool for extra heat protection.
