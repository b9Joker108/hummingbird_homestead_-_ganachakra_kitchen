# Pin Cushion #

I need to go second-hand/opp-shoppe/thift-shopping for a woolen jumper to process and repurpose into batting for my pot-holder project. Whilst at it, I will look for two fabrics I like, that work together with pattern and colour, appropriate for purpose, to re-purpose for this pin cushion.
