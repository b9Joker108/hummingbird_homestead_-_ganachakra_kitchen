# Electric Drill Bits: An Introduction #

- **Wood drill bits** are designed to cut through soft materials and have brad points that may damage or chip hard plastics or stone surfaces.
- **Ceramic drill bits** often refer to carbide-tipped masonry bits designed for drilling into hard materials like tile, brick, or stone. These are suitable for stone and ceramic but not optimized for plastic or perspex, which may crack under such bits[3][4][7].
- **Metal drill bits (high-speed steel, cobalt, or titanium-coated bits)** work well for metals and some softer materials but tend to chew, melt, or crack plastics and perspex unless they are specifically ground and sharpened for plastic drilling. Plastic drill bits have a different point geometry (often 60° tip) to avoid chipping and cracking acrylics such as perspex[1][2][8].

To summarize:
- Use **masonry/ceramic (carbide-tipped)** bits for stone or ceramic only.
- Use **special plastic or acrylic drill bits** (with a 60° angle tip and sharp edges) for perspex and most plastics—these prevent cracking and chipping.
- Avoid using wood or metal drill bits on stone or clear plastics as they can cause damage and poor quality holes[1][2].

If you need to drill perspex or acrylic, purchase dedicated acrylic/plastic drill bits for best results. For stone or ceramic, use masonry bits designed to cut through hard surfaces. Wood and metal bits are too specialized for their intended materials and generally incompatible across these hard and brittle materials[1][2][3][7].

This material-specific approach avoids damage and ensures effective, clean drilling.
