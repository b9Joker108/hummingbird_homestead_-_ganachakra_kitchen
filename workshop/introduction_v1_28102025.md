A need an idiots guide on setting up a workshop and how to decide on essential tools and know how to determine what to purchase and why and how much, etc., an Idiots guide?

To provide a clear, beginner-friendly guide on setting up a workshop and deciding on essential tools, let's organize the information into straightforward steps covering:

1. Determining your workshop needs and goals
2. Choosing a good workspace and workbench
3. Identifying essential basic tools categories (hand, power, safety)
4. How to decide which tools to purchase and why
5. Budgeting advice and buying tips
6. Tool maintenance and organization basics

The gathered sources show consensus on starting simple with core hand tools and a sturdy workbench, picking tools that fit your project type and materials, investing in quality for durability, and organizing to keep your workspace efficient and safe [1][2][3][4].

Next, I will synthesize these into a clear "idiots guide" style answer.
